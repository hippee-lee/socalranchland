<p>on it. You can also access the Spotlight search from the Finder. In fact it might be easier for a beginner to use since it will show you the path to your missing file after you click on it.</p>

<li>Organizing files on the desktop. First minimize or use Expose to clear all windows from the screen so you can see the desktop. Then make sure focus is on the desktop by clicking anywhere on it andÃ‚Â select all files (Command + a). Now you can use the view menu to organize the files/folders on you desktop as you wish. TO get started I recommend selecting all, View/Keep Arranged By/Name to put them in alphabetical order.</li>
