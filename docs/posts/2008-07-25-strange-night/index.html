<p>wants Hannah to get more comfortable with him. Apparently Hannah does to my Dad the same thing she does to me when Julie is around. If Mom comes into the room and Dad and Hannah are playing, Hannah gets upset and wants Mom to come over to her and pay attention. Sound familiar? üôÇ We are going to go to the Concert in the Park tonight and I will try to post some pictures on the webpage for you by√É‚Äö√Ç tomorrow√É‚Äö√Ç morning. Depending on how things go tonight I might try to go see the new X-Files movie at one of the later showings. Everyone at work raves about the Dark NIght so we shall have to find some time to go see that when you get back.</p>

<p>I started to read GEB last night before I went to sleep. The intro is very interesting and it reminds me alot of the Seven Mysteries Of Life book from the 60&#8217;s. It&#8217;s long but it√É‚Äö√Ç should√É‚Äö√Ç be a good read.</p>
