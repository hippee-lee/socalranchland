<p>So here is the rough dump of my thoughts on this software:</p>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I have lots of data sources, some with PII (Personally Identifying Information): <ul>
        <li>
          Photo software databases
        </li>
        <li>
          Email archives
        </li>
        <li>
          Documents
        </li>
        <li>
          Social Stuff Online: Twitter, google, bitbucket, etc, etc
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal website for brain dump and grandparent kiddo photos
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      I need a simple text box entry point that will return google esque search  results from just that data set, organized by: <ul>
        <li>
          Date(s)
        </li>
        <li>
          Places
        </li>
        <li>
          Photos
        </li>
        <li>
          Videos
        </li>
        <li>
          Text
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      It will require: <ul>
        <li>
          A service to index, scrape and store the assets
        </li>
        <li>
          An interface to interact and modify (meta) data as I wish
        </li>
        <li>
          Security & Account Management
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to mindlessly grant/admin access to ‘layers’ of digital me. This is pretty rough: <ul>
            <li>
              But by default everything is private, even if I let you log in.
            </li>
            <li>
              The interface lets me find and move sets of assets to concentric circles of access with all of ‘Digital Me’ at the center.
            </li>
            <li>
              For some folks, like my wife, daughter (when she is old enough) the can add to me
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  

<p><p>
    Here is the why. My wife and I updated out trust and last year and it got me thinking about the 1.5 TB of data I have collected in the past eleven years. Think about the substantial level of PII and PRI (My own term: Personally Relevant Information) that is useful to the &#8216;Family&#8217; circle is huge there. This raised some questions I want the above software to be able to answer:
  </p></p>

<p><div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How will my daughter answer questions like what was Matts favorite childhood memory? Who were Matt’s grandparents? Where were they from? Most of those answers are in my data … but not accessible
      </li>
      <li>
        How will my daughters grandchildren answer these questions? I can’t easily answer them for myself with out a lot of time and effort to find the right relative to ask. In fact I have asked some things and enjoyed learning the history of my family but forgotten about it. If only my great grandparents could have had the tools I have today &#8211; the insight into forces that shaped my family, me is a compelling idea for me.
      </li>
    </ul></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></div></p>

<p><p>
    Obviously this is a tall order. I used to think that other much smarter people, who made successful technologies and sometimes millions, would think of this and I could pay them to use their tools. Alas, nothing that I know of has come to the forefront. If they can build giant robotic farms that scrape the content of the internet, surely I can build a tool that help and extends introspection for myself.
