            <div class="post-content">
                <p>It says more about congress than Facebook that the American congress has a childish understanding of computers, networks and algorithms. They are woefully uneducated and inarticulate when it comes to discussing the technical aspects of data and Facebook and how the two impact the social fabric.</p>

<p>Watching senator after senator ask questions that clearly demonstrate this lack of understanding on a fundamental level I&#8217;m left with the question, are they even qualified to bring legislation that will address the social impacts that data collection by corporations has on society? Based on the questions that are asking I&#8217;m left with a resounding no. Hell no even. I do not want someone who doesn&#8217;t understand technology making and passing laws that govern the use of technology.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s also concerning is the lack of focus on the broader issues related to data collection. They clearly want to find someone at Facebook to pin blame on for what&#8217;s already happen but I see no interest in the bigger question, &#8216;How should corporations be held accountable for the data they collect and store about the people who are customers or use their services?&#8217; It strikes me as odd that these senators chose this incident to hold very public congressional hearings. Yes, around 100MM people were affected by the Facebook breach. Where were they when Target incident happened? Why did they not hold hearings after the Equifax credit rating breaches and the em more disturbing &#8211; why are they not outraged by the shady money grab that Equifax is pushing. You know the one, your data could have been stolen (no shit Sherlock, they stole it from you) pay us $10 a month and we will make sure your credit score isn&#8217;t impacted. If that&#8217;s not a racketeering scam than things have changed since the old mob shakedowns in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>What bothers me about congress is that&#8217;ll they feel entitled to ask Facebook, despite their flaws, a company clearly more adept at managing technology that the US government, why they (the senators &amp; American citizens) should trust Facebook with their data. The unasked but far more important question here is, &#8216;Why should the American people should trust congress to pass laws about technology when the majority of those in office clearly have a grade school (high school at best) understanding of computers, networks and technology?&#8217;</p>

<p>Last thought. Perhaps it&#8217;s me but I found the irony in an exchange between one (white) senator in a sea of (white) senators question the lack of diversity on the leadership team at Facebook. To me that screams of the hypocrisy that defines both democratic and republican parties and is a cancer on the soul of America.</p>
