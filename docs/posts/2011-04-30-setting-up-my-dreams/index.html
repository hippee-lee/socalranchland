<p>-Albert Einstein</p>

<p>I have never written down my goals and usually [day]dream ideas and things I want to do when I am driving. Thats likely why I am only an average driver and make myself ignore the phone &#8211; there is only so much processing power my brain can do at one time. There are several variations to the same themes in my daydreams &#8211; snowboarding every day, solving interesting and profitable problems, migrating around the world with Julie to see and do fun things and showing Hannah the things I like to do and have found to be useful to know.</p>

<p>In the book they say when you write your dreams down they become goals. It isn&#8217;t just writing them down though the most successful people review them on an ongoing basis. Perhaps the problem to be solved is two fold; first, my brain needs something concrete to focus on and second, in order to make progress towards my dreams (which are hazy and and ill defined patterns in my stream of thought) the dream needs to be refined as I understand it better, as I know myself better.</p>

<p>Here are some of my recent</p>

<p>[day]dreams:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have multiple places to live: in mountains, near large bodies of water and close to family.</li>
<li>Create a profitable business that supports us and is run asynchronously.</li>
<li>Hike the Pacific Crest Trail, start to finish.</li>
<li>Fly Julie to the Mediterranean Sea for a romantic dinner on the beach under a full moon.</li>
<li>Sitting and watching the sun and moon rise and set.</li>
<li>Heli-snowboarding in Alaska.</li>
</ul>

<p>Achieving these dreams means having balance. As a Libran, I have a great appreciation for balance: I have experienced it in math, biology, <a href="http://hippeelee.com/blog/category/riding/">riding</a>, parenting, marriage. I&#8217;m not sure I understand it yet but I&#8217;m still learning.</p>
