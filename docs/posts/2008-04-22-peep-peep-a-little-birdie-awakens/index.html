    We took the pups with us and they had a great time. I got repriminded by the dude form open spaces because Gurgi was not on a leash. Even though he was on heel next to my side. I saw a bunch of places where some well meaning person had but branches across the traiL,Ã‚Â ostentatiouslyÃ‚Â to stopÃ‚Â mountainÃ‚Â bikers from riding the line in the trail that takes you up the bank of the trail. I am not sure why they do this but is is pretty dangerous for theÃ‚Â mountainÃ‚Â bikers. Ã‚Â Boulders attitude to Mountain Bikers and Dogs is the weirdest I have seen; in all of the places I have lived. Apparently, open mindedness,Ã‚Â understandingÃ‚Â and harmonious living do not apply to Mountain Bikers and Canines.Ã‚Â
