She also started saying &amp;#8220;uh oh&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; as in bah, and generally became very vocal with everyone when she was not extremely tired from lack of sleep. She is also trying to climb everything like mad.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â " />

    We had a blast in Maui for vacation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I must say that is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">really hard</span>Ã‚Â slightly more difficult than usual to travel with Hannah. It was waaay different from the last time Julie and I went though. Then, we were on our honeymoon ad this time we were bringing Hannah bear.Ã‚Â Hannah only weighs ~20lbs but we brought what seemed like 120lbs of stuff for her. Babies require a lot of stuff.Ã‚Â
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hannah started signing &#8216;more&#8217; for anything that she wanted, food, water, milk, and her momma. The second night there, it was my turn to take her when she woke up, she was on my bed and I was trying to get her to go back to sleep for an hour or so since it was only 3:30. She was having none of it. When she heard momma turn over on her bed she stood up, leaned on me and started frantically signing &#8216;more.&#8217; It was very cute. She also started saying &#8220;uh oh&#8217;, &#8216;b&#8217; as in bah, and generally became very vocal with everyone when she was not extremely tired from lack of sleep. She is also trying to climb everything like mad.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

    We got in a couple of snorkeling days and one day of diving with Lahaina Divers. We took a boat over to Lananai and did two morning dives. Both dives took us through some cool lava formations and caves. Lots of fishes, coral and other marine wildlife. I have some more details in my dive book.Ã‚Â While we were diving the grandparents took Hannah to the Maui Ocean Center Aquarium and from the pictures, it looks like they had a blast.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The supposedly waterproof camera was not waterproof. The first day I took it into the ocean to film Hannah in her floaty it lasted about ten minutes. I&#8217;ll need to dig up the credit cardÃ‚Â receipt, the boxÃ‚Â receiptÃ‚Â and see what I need to do to either exchange it, return it or get it fixed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We all got a few naps in the afternoon andÃ‚Â thoroughlyÃ‚Â enjoyed our visit with all four grandparents. Hannah did very well on the really, really long plane rides. I wish we could have stayed longer.Ã‚Â
