                <p>I know that the updated messaging get a lot of press after the last iOS update. And it is good, from what I have seen Julie do with it. I&#8217;m going to have to wait a bit longer to get some more experience with it when the iPhone 5 comes out. While I still think the webOS did notifications much better they improved it too. If they could only figure out a way to get webOS notifications and something close to the synergy sync that made contact management so painless on webOS.</p>

<p>Anyway, this ins&#8217;t about any of that, it is the biggest thing. On the coolness factoer scale the touchstone was by far the coolest thing, not just because of the nice magnet charging base. I think the wireless sync that the last iOS upgrade included is on par with that. Hannah got a new Barbie movie on DVD last weekend. So I ripped it on my laptop and transfered the file over to the mini hooked up to the tv that is used to sync the iOS devices of my to lovely ladies. Once it was on there and copied into Julies iTUnes library it was trivial to push</p>

<p>it out to both the iPad plugged in upstairs and the iPod Touch in Hannahs room. mark a checkbox, take off some My LIttle Pony&#8217;s for the Touch and hit sync. Now she has it there and she can watch it on the TV. That was painless, easy and makes it accessible to her on three different devices. I know iCloud is supposed to do something similar but after my experiences with .mac and MobileM, lets just say I&#8217;m skeptical and will wait for them to work the bugs out before I ride that train.</p>

<p>One thing could make it cooler &#8211; an awesome induction charging station for the pretty iOS devices. I can see them hanging rom the wall next my bed or in the office. Replacing the thermostat once more companies can do what the Tendril Platform can do for consumers (although the electrical companies need to cooperate and I think their organizations are too old and outdated to see the potential locked up in freeing a consumers data to the consumer. They are going to likely take the music/book/movie approach and nickel and dime their customers until they eventually get replaced). Anyway, a shiny new iPad3 with induction charging dock station mounted to my wall, thats what I see. I wonder if it is possible?</p>
