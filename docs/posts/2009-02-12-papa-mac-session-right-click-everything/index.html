SELECTING ALL:
Command &#43; a (command is the apple key with the squiggly shape on it next to the space bar) will select all the items in the application that has focus. So if you have e folder like &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos&amp;#8217; opens via the Finder it will select all of the photos in there.
CONTEXT MENU:
Control &#43; left mouse click will bring up a context menu. This is the same as a right click from the mouse. Wen you bring up a context menu the options in the context menu are dependent on the application that has focus.
COMBINING ACTIONS:
You can combine both of these actions to do things. For example, last night you wanted to delete all the pictures in the &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos.&amp;#8217; I had you select them all with [command &#43; a] and then send them all to trash by right clicking on a selected (highlighted in blue in your case) to bring up the context menu and choocing/clicking on send to trash.

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Below is a brief synopsis of what we did tonight using yuuguu to share screens and learn about basic mac functions.</p>

<p>SELECTING ALL:</p>

<p>Command + a (command is the apple key with the squiggly shape on it next to the space bar) will select all the items in the application that has focus. So if you have e folder like &#8216;Scanned Photos&#8217; opens via the Finder it will select all of the photos in there.</p>

<p>CONTEXT MENU:</p>

<p>Control + left mouse click will bring up a context menu. This is the same as a right click from the mouse. Wen you bring up a context menu the options in the context menu are dependent on the application that has focus.</p>

<p>COMBINING ACTIONS:</p>

<p>You can combine both of these actions to do things. For example, last night you wanted to delete all the pictures in the &#8216;Scanned Photos.&#8217; I had you select them all with [command + a] and then send them all to trash by right clicking on a selected (highlighted in blue in your case) to bring up the context menu and choocing/clicking on send to trash.</p>

<p>RIGHT CLICKING:</p>

<p>Right clicking EVERYTHING is a good way see what actions you can do. You can learn alot about</p>

<p>the way your operating system works by right clicking on anything and everything.</p>

<p>MULTI-SELECTING:</p>

<p>Multi selecting files. In last nights session we were working with picture files. We were selecting several photos and dragging them from the desktop to a folder. You also saw me select multiple photos and move them from one Finder window to a second finder window.</p>

<p>FINDER SHORT CUTS:</p>

<p>Finally we put a short cut to the Scanned Photos folder back into the Finders Navigation area under &#8216;Places&#8217;</p>

<p>DELETING IN iPhoto:</p>

<p>Deleting from iPhoto &#8211; We learned that iPhoto has its own trash can icon on the left hand side. in order to delete photos from iPhoto youhave to select one or more photos and then drag them to the iPhoto Trash can.</p>

<p>DELETING IN FINDER:</p>

<p>Deleting from Finder Windows &#8211; there are two ways we deleted from the Finder. We found some misplaced photos that you had scanned into the the wrong location. first we selected some or all of the pictures, then we used the mouse and right clicked on a highlighted picture, held the mouse button and dragged to the trash can on the Dock. Then I showed you the easy way, you selected some pictures and right clicked on them. This brought up the context menu that gave you the option to &#8216;Move to Trash&#8217;</p>

<p>EMPTYING THE TRASH:</p>

<p>Finally you right clicked on the trash can icon in the dock and used the easy way to empty the trash by choosing &#8216;Empty Trash&#8217; from the context menu that appears.</p>

<p>Ideas for matt to help him dad remember: put this in a blog post. Make some short tutorial using the Jing app and post them on your blog as well so Dad can have some links to them. I should prolly make dad his own special (sub)category so he can have one link to find all of the posts that are from our sessions &#8230; Dad&#8217;s Computer Sessions??</p>
