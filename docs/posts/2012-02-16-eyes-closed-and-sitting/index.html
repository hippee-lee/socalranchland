                <p>As I sit here and try to see what it is that I want I see hazy unfocused shapes moving around in a milky white fog. What is it I need to do and how do I want to get that done? There is more than just the gears behind the clock face.</p>

<p>It takes quite a bit of time to put the shortest bit of delight together. Delight that is fleeting only because of the amount of thought and attention to detail that went into it. Take <a href="http://hippeelee.com/julie/vday">cards</a> for example. No matter where they are found there is far more time in preparing them for consumption that the actual consumption which could only be a few seconds. They comunicate ideas and emotions simply (at least my favorite ones do) and they do it with extreme efficiency.</p>

<p>Think about the last card you gave. Most likely, you picked it up at a store, signed your name to it and sent it on its way. Perhaps you took the time to write a more personal note. All of the hard stuff was done for you: which card stock to use, how many colors to use in the graphic design on the front in inside,</p>

<p>which words to print for the genre of card. Once all of those decisions had been made it was easy to print that line of cards off so you can jot down a little, extra note and your signature.</p>

<p>Then, in even less time the recipient gets a personalized idea or emotion straight from you. Depending on how many words this happens in seconds and knowledge is transferred from you to them.</p>

<p>I think about this because I am looking for a system that will let me share specifically targeted information about myself in a similar but much more modern fashion and it helps to start with my eyes closed. Are the bits of information visible to start with or just really small? How do they enter the awareness of the audience? Is it scale or transformation or both. Is it still minimal if they do both with some skewing?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure yet but one thing I know. Being able to prototype my page using the browser console is very useful.</p>
