                <p>There are guidelines to everything under the sun. Getting what you want, where you want, how you want is just another process that we all go through. It can always be done differently but the savvy folks learn to look at the lessons learned by those who traveled before them and apply their lessons appropriately. These are guidelines. With that said, Keep these in mind when you are designing your path:</p>

<ol>
<li>The system was destroyed last night. Today is an opportunity for you to rebuild it in a way that suites you best.

<ol>
<li>Focus on what you would like if you could have whatever is ideal for you; do not focus on what you want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span>.</li>
<li>When someone disagrees with you, understand why they disagree and learn what they would do differently.</li>
<li>Focus on smaller focused changes as they can be controlled in the &#8216;real world.&#8217;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind the following; outside of an organizational structure where rules, etiquette and purpose are mutually agreed upon, the really real world will over only the easy feedback. This is easy but to improve on it you will have to fix it for yourself.</p>

<h5 id="make-a-mess-clean-it-up-http-www-folklore-org-storyview-py-story-make-a-mess-clean-it-up-txt"><a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Make_a_Mess,_Clean_it_Up!.txt">Make a mess, clean it up.</a></h5>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Instead of avoiding the tough situations, he&#8217;d immediately create them, and immediately start learning how to handle the worst situation imaginable. Pretty soon he would routinely handle anything the machine could throw at him.&#8221;</span></p>
