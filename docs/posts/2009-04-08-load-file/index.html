<p>Just what I wanted to do, run my code all at once. If I had more time I could even bind a custom keystroke in my init file and not have to type all of that text out.

<p>memory it can have and use, not sure about apache though. The issue seems to be when the page needs to read or write from the database. I wonder if 1) php is not letting go of the memory its using to access the db. If so is that something thats configured on the db or in php.ini? 2) would dtrace help me find the bug? 3) if I upgraded the server OS and php would that fix the issue.</p>

<p>In the interest of not losing an entire weekend I&#8217;ll try #3 first since I can pull most of what I want from my backup disk after the upgrade. If, after the upgrade, the errors still happen I&#8217;ll have access to dtrace and maybe that will give me a clue as to whats going on down there. I need to back up and dump my dbs first. but perhaps this weekend if I don&#8217;t get any more x-file dvd&#8217;s from netflix.</p>
