There are birds chirping and I hear some muted &amp;#8220;whoo hoo&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; in the trees. There are 2-4 foot drifts in the trees and some thigh high drifts up on top of Vasquez Cirque. Yummy! The next run is Certainty and the ridge that gets the most snow, at least that&amp;#8217;s what I think.
It certainly did. I opted out of dropping off the cornice that forms on the left side of the run for the grove of trees and really big rocks on the right. Up top the un-tracked powder was thigh high at least. When the slope is that steep the turns are so smooth and easy it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like turning on a snowboard. Once I got below the trees to where the rocks form a narrow gully, about ten feet wide I stopped to pick my line. Between the two largest rocks there is a nice channel that drops left, back into the Certainty slope and I had a very fast run out in the powder field below where I got some more beautiful turns. Then, below the next ridge, down underneath the tree line it was good, really good. Its a lot of work to get over there

<p>but so worth it. I wish they either had a tow rope up top or a quick double chair that started mid valley and went back up to the top of the ridge. Oh well at least the hike keeps the slopes pretty clear for me.</p>

<p>I did some other runs down eagle wind and the main lift that services winter park. When there is that much snow (@ least 16&#8243; everywhere and up to my ribcage on top of VC) it&#8217;s easy to have a few nice mogul sessions.</p>
