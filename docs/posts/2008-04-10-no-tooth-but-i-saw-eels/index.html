I saw the eels show last night. Went with M my neighbor and a group of people. Was a good show at the Fox Theater in Boulder. A little crowded but atmosphere was pretty intimate and he puts on an entertaining show. He played a wide range of selections (old and new) and I found out that he is a really good drummer. Before the show they were playing the DVD that came out with his latest album. I saw that he also has a book so I found it on amazon this morning and placed an order. Should be an interesting read.
It snowed today and I think that will hold up Cheryle and Paul. They stayed in Grand Junction last night and will get here today if there isn&amp;#8217;t

<p>to much snow in the high country. Speaking of snow, maybe I can talk Cory into going up to Berthoud Pass this week end and getting some runs?Ã‚Â I expect that Paul and Cheryle will be happy that the weekend is supposed to be upper 60&#8217;s and sunny. I know I am. Hannah has started doing so many things since they last saw her; sitting up (almost on her own, very vocal, grabbing stuff, eating &#8216;real&#8217; baby food.</p>
