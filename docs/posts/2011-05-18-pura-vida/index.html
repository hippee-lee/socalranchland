Monteverde was lush &amp;#8211; the biodiversity is amazing. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to re-read EO Wilsons book &amp;#8220;The Diversity of Life&amp;#8221; again because it was about places like this. We spent a day in the national park and our guide was very knowledgable of the flora and fauna. She especially liked birds. Besides the forest I saw signs of mountain biking in the area and would be very excited to come back and ride here&amp;#8230;
After a too short stay in our almost private resort we drove down the coast to Manuel Antonio and went diving yesterday. Despite the murky visibility we saw a lot ot wildlife. Today the plan is to hike the national park here and end up at the beach. Hannah has gotten a lot of pool time but only a little beach time so far.
I&amp;#8217;ve gotten some really good pictures but I can&amp;#8217;t post them yet. I&amp;#8217;m using Julies iPad to post this and besides the annoying typing corrections, it lacks the ability to post
