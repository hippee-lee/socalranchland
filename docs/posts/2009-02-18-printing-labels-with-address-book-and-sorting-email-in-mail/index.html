            <div class="post-content">
                <p><strong>Address Book</strong>: Mom needs some labels printed out so we started by selecting some contacts in the address book to print and setting up some preset Avery labels by label number. The workflow is as follows: Select one or more contacts to print, then choose File &gt; Print. In the print dialog that pops up choose Mailing Labels as the Style and the Layout option. Now you can specify the page (We chose Avery Standard because they are printing on normal 8.5 x 11 paper) and then the label id number: 8160. WHen he did a test print of 10 contacts on a scrap piece of paper he found out that the left margin was off so we set up a custom label that was almost like the preset. We made note of the Margins: Top, Left, Right and Bottom and the gutters (vertical and horizontal space between individual labels), the number of rows and columns. Since the preset had the incorrect left margin we chose &#8220;Define Custom: as the page and put in the noted top, bottom, right and gutterÃ‚Â measurementsÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â preset.We setÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â columnsÃ‚Â at two and the rows at 5. Ã‚Â Then since it was the</p>

<p>left margin that was giving us a problem weÃ‚Â guesstimatedÃ‚Â a new distance that would work for us and tested it on ten more contacts. It worked. Now all Dad has to do is put in the rest of theirÃ‚Â rolodexÃ‚Â and he can print as many labels as he needs.Ã‚Â</p>

<p><strong>Mail.app:</strong> I forwarded him a picture Julie sent to me of Hannah in Cali. SInce we were screen sharing with Yuuguu I noticed that when heÃ‚Â receivedÃ‚Â it he had to scroll all the way down to the bottom of his inbox to find it. Enter Sorting. I showed him how to click on the Date Received column and make note of the little arrow that appears there. After clicking on the column the arrow pointing down means sort emails by DateÃ‚Â receivedÃ‚Â descending:Ã‚Â i.e.Ã‚Â put the most recent email at the top of the inbox. Clicking on the &#8216;Date Received&#8217; column Ã‚Â again flips the arrow so it points up, now the inbox is sorted by ascending order:Ã‚Â i.e.Ã‚Â the most recent emails are at the bottom of the list. I mentioned that he can also sort by From alphabetically ascending or alphabetically descending. THe last thing I showed him was how to save an attached image to iPhoto. The easiest way is to click on the quick look button and hover over the two icons at the bottom. The two arrows will make the picture go to full screen and the other icon, a squareÃ‚Â withÃ‚Â a camera in front of it will save the image to iPhoto.Ã‚Â</p>

<p><strong>Review:</strong> dad showed me how he imports his scanned photos into iPhoto. He opened the Scanned Photo&#8217;s folder, that lives on his Desktop, and selected all (command + a) the images in there. Next he dragged them to the iPhoto icon on his dock. iPhoto then bounced a few times and came up showing a message and progress bar that was importing the images. After the images were imported he closed iPhoto and right clicked on the selected images in the &#8216;Scanned Photos&#8217; folder. This brought up the context menu with the option to &#8216;Move To Trash,&#8217; which he selected. Then he right clicked on the Trash can on the right hand of the dock and chose &#8216;Empty Trash&#8217; from the context menu that popped up.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>And thats all!</p>
