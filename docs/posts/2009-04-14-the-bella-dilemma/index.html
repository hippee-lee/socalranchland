Bella has been missing the last few days. Julie last saw her by Black Rock Elementary on Thursday. We have been letting her out during the day because she gets really crazy when she is confined to the house 24&amp;frasl;7. We though she was gone because we didn&amp;#8217;t have a tag with our numbers on there but I just confirmed that she is at the BVHS (Boulder Valley Humane Society).
My dilemma is if we should keep letting her out or not. I am aware of the risks but I wonder if it is crueler to keep her inside all of the time (and crazy) or let her out where she can take her chances and happily goes about her business. I know I would always opt for taking my chances but I am not a cat. Since she is a cat and she can&amp;#8217;t really tell me what she wants, other that to observe her behavior; her behavior tells me that she likes to go outside. I think we will try to find a happy medium: she can still go outside, but only when we are there in the yard. We will also be getting her a tag for her collar
