<p>is always on and operating systems (until today) were shipped on cd&#8217;s and dvd&#8217;s. Also, on you are never all the way right, but if your site is down you are always wrong. So they found find ways to get closer to right. And learned from the mistakes. I don&#8217;t know about the best ways to produce software but I do know when I use software I like.</p>

<p>When it&#8217;s software I don&#8217;t like I can still practice &#8211; patience and repetition. It seems that is what it comes down to for many things. Patience and repetition. Just. Keep Going.</p>
