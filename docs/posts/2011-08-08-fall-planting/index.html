            <div class="post-content">
                <p>We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grasses in back, next to the railing &#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide</li>
<li>Barberry plants &#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide</li>
<li>Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch connector</p>

<p>lines for a more flexible watering delivery. Watering times will be every day at 8:15am and 11:55pm separate from the lawn watering schedule which is once a day during weekdays, later at night.</p>

<div>
  I also got some seeds into the garden. From the golf course side, here are the four rows:</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Spinach (Planted every six inches)
    </li>
    <li>
      Broccoli (Planted every two feet)
    </li>
    <li>
      Bibb Lettuce (Planted every six inches)
    </li>
    <li>
      Baby Bok Choy (Planted every six inches)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The only thing I am worried about is that I may have put the seeds to deep before I covered them with top soil. I also fed all the beds with a three month garden/shrub time release system that Mom and Dad left here in 2009.
