            <description>It says more about congress than Facebook that the American congress has a childish understanding of computers, networks and algorithms. They are woefully uneducated and inarticulate when it comes to discussing the technical aspects of data and Facebook and how the two impact the social fabric.
Watching senator after senator ask questions that clearly demonstrate this lack of understanding on a fundamental level I&amp;#8217;m left with the question, are they even qualified to bring legislation that will address the social impacts that data collection by corporations has on society?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It says more about congress than Facebook that the American congress has a childish understanding of computers, networks and algorithms. They are woefully uneducated and inarticulate when it comes to discussing the technical aspects of data and Facebook and how the two impact the social fabric.</p>

<p>Watching senator after senator ask questions that clearly demonstrate this lack of understanding on a fundamental level I&#8217;m left with the question, are they even qualified to bring legislation that will address the social impacts that data collection by corporations has on society? Based on the questions that are asking I&#8217;m left with a resounding no. Hell no even. I do not want someone who doesn&#8217;t understand technology making and passing laws that govern the use of technology.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s also concerning is the lack of focus on the broader issues related to data collection. They clearly want to find someone at Facebook to pin blame on for what&#8217;s already happen but I see no interest in the bigger question, &#8216;How should corporations be held accountable for the data they collect and store about the people who are customers or use their services?&#8217; It strikes me as odd that these senators chose this incident to hold very public congressional hearings. Yes, around 100MM people were affected by the Facebook breach. Where were they when Target incident happened? Why did they not hold hearings after the Equifax credit rating breaches and the em more disturbing &#8211; why are they not outraged by the shady money grab that Equifax is pushing. You know the one, your data could have been stolen (no shit Sherlock, they stole it from you) pay us $10 a month and we will make sure your credit score isn&#8217;t impacted. If that&#8217;s not a racketeering scam than things have changed since the old mob shakedowns in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>What bothers me about congress is that&#8217;ll they feel entitled to ask Facebook, despite their flaws, a company clearly more adept at managing technology that the US government, why they (the senators &amp; American citizens) should trust Facebook with their data. The unasked but far more important question here is, &#8216;Why should the American people should trust congress to pass laws about technology when the majority of those in office clearly have a grade school (high school at best) understanding of computers, networks and technology?&#8217;</p>

<p>Last thought. Perhaps it&#8217;s me but I found the irony in an exchange between one (white) senator in a sea of (white) senators question the lack of diversity on the leadership team at Facebook. To me that screams of the hypocrisy that defines both democratic and republican parties and is a cancer on the soul of America.</p>

            <description>I am struggling to get back into my morning routine. Even though I know its good for me its been a struggle for the past few weeks to get up and get going. Part of it is me. I am a creature of habit and routine. Get me off my routine and it seems like everything has fundamentally changed and it takes cycles to get back on.
Maybe telling myself that I will do it is enough.</description>

<p>A team composed of several specialists (doctors, anthropologists, demographers, nutritionists, epidemiologists) – and led by Dan Buettner himself – travelled many times to the different blue zones. They identified the following nine general longevity factors, which are related to diet and lifestyle:</p>

<p>1 intense and regular physical activity in the performance of daily duties. The concept of a sedentary lifestyle is unknown to the people living in these regions</p>

<p>2 having an “ikigai” – a Japanese word (Okinawa) which is used to define our own “reasons for being” or, more precisely, the reasons why we wake up every morning</p>

<p>3 reduction of stress, a factor which is closely linked to almost all ageing-related diseases. Stress reduction means interrupting the normal pace of our daily lives in order to allow time for other activities which are part of normal social habits. For example, taking a nap in Mediterranean societies, praying in the case of Adventists, the tea ceremony of women in Okinawa, and so on.</p>

<p>4 “Hara hachi bu” – a Confucian teaching that means we should not continue to eat until we are full, but only until 80% of our eating capacity</p>

<p>5 prioritising a diet that is rich in plant-based products. Meat, fish and dairy products may be consumed, but in lower amounts</p>

<p>6 a moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages, which confirms the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11739-010-0346-0">belief that moderate drinkers live longer lives than nondrinkers</a></p>

<p>7 engaging in social groups that promote healthy habits</p>

<p>8 engaging in religious communities with common religious practices</p>

<p>9 building and maintaining solid relationships between family members: parents, siblings, grandparents and others.</p>

<p>To sum up, the above nine longevity factors could be synthesised in just two.</p>

            <description>I need to establish a new routine that lets me make progress on my personal goals.&amp;nbsp;
Every week I need to review and document myself.&amp;nbsp;
First, I need to commit to those nebulous goals that roll around in my head. The things I’ll do someday and the ideas that I can visualize with a hazy lack of clarity but keep floating to the surface.&amp;nbsp;

<p>Every week I need to review and document myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, I need to commit to those nebulous goals that roll around in my head. The things I’ll do someday and the ideas that I can visualize with a hazy lack of clarity but keep floating to the surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the Principles book:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have clear goals.</li>
<li>Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.</li>
<li>Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.</li>
<li>Design plans that will get you around them.</li>
<li>Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two things that come to mind as I sit here writing this are the MALU:silent-guild book and the Pathmates app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have eight years before I turn 50. Surely that’s enough time to visualize, create and breath life into both projects.&nbsp;</p>

            <description>&amp;#8220;Why do you run from them?&amp;#8221; she asks him. A simple question with an answer like all answers &amp;#8211; more complicated the the deeper you get under the surface of what&amp;#8217;s obvious. The human psyche is a hall full of smoke and mirrors. Even when we choose the right path we are lucky more often than we are right.&amp;nbsp;

<p>&#8220;Little one,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we can always choose who joins our long walk along the path.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that, they are well met. Well met in the parlance of history long forgotten and remembered by only a few few who were there in the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

I hate that some of those comments are from friends and family who are good people and when I engage with them its an unproductive conversation about apples and oranges.

    <span data-offset-key="8kbn6-0-0">I read comments that demonstrate a complete incapacity of empathizing with the other viewpoint for the sake of discussion and I don&#8217;t understand why. In some ways its sad because I want to participate in the conversation but can&#8217;t get over the feeling that it&#8217;s pointless when the folks who are online can&#8217;t differentiate between empathy (for the sake of understanding and persuasion) and sympathy (feeling sorry for someone&#8217;s different state of mind and belief system). If you can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) put yourself in someone else&#8217;s shoes you will never understand them. And as Carmine Falcone said, &#8220;And you always fear what you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</span>

    <span data-offset-key="296au-0-0">The point to the intro above is to highlight how difficult it is to have a real, meaningful and production conversation online when politics and science are involved. Many folks never actually seek out the research or data so they can come to their own conclusions. It&#8217;s kind of like buying the first thing in an Amazon product search without reading the description (research) or product reviews (peer review). Only shitty consumers would do that, right? Same thing when you consume scientific research, if you outsource it by letting any news organization summarize it for you then you are missing out on the experience of doing your own shopping. You are stuck with their biases and mistakes.</span>

Its long but will help the conversation if we all have a common baseline to start our arguments with. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you draw different conclusions from mine. We can&#8217;t have a good conversation about it if we are not referencing the same data. Again, its long but you can do it. Take it one section at a time and digest it like a good meal.

This is neither good or bad, it is where we are today. At least, thats what I conclude after reading the linked paper below. My first (educational) love in life was biology &#8211; I was and still am fasciated by the almost magical way that life evolves and survives on our planet. One of the things I took away from my hybrid education in the real world and college is that, collectively, we are responsible for what happens to life on this planet. If we something wrong and there is something we can do to help we have a moral and ethical responsibility to address it. Pretending something isn&#8217;t a problem or that its not &#8220;my&#8221; problem is unscrupulus and un-ethical. And, me or my child&#8217;s grand-children&#8217;s children will have to clean it up. If they survive.</span>

 It starts with me and I don&amp;#8217;t take critique well. I struggle with shutting my mouth long enough for the rational part of my brain to separate the intel I have been given from the emotional response that desperately wants to leap from my mouth.</description>

<p>I could use some of this flavor of comedy after hearing about all of the fake news this week. The rules have changes for sure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems like they are the same as last time around. Same as they always are.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It starts with me and I don&#8217;t take critique well. I struggle with shutting my mouth long enough for the rational part of my brain to separate the intel I have been given from the emotional response that desperately wants to leap from my mouth.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten better at knee jerk reactions. I try to have empathy first when interacting in life. That helps but its a constant practice just to make progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The thing about constant practice is that it&#8217;s humbling to go back to the basics and force yourself to &#8216;brush up&#8217; on something you take for granted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the biggest challenge for the American voter. Learning to learn with empathy. We think they know our government. We don&#8217;t. We think we know politics. We don&#8217;t. We think we know our fellow americons. We don&#8217;t. We make the same mistake I&#8217;ve seen many a start-up &#8216;founder&#8217; make. They know the product and if it gets built the users will come. But come hell or high water they don&#8217;t need to talk to people to understand <em>what</em>&nbsp;to build. They already know what to build. And build they do. Right up until they have wasted all the money, without ever having engaged in conversation with their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talk to the people, that is the key. It takes empathy and adaptability but it will unlock the imagination of ourselves and the new American Dream.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="of-my-distracted-mind"><strong>OF MY DISTRACTED MIND</strong></h4>

<p>These are the suggestions that stood out for me in the last two chapters of the book, &#8216;The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains In A High-Tech World&#8217;</p>

<h3 id="stimulate-neuroplasticity"><strong>STIMULATE NEUROPLASTICITY</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Traditional &amp; modern approaches to education</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Nature exposure</li>
<li>Cognitive exercises</li>
<li>Video game training</li>
<li>Physical exercise</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="traditional-modern-educational-approaches">TRADITIONAL &amp; MODERN EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES</h4>

<p>Enhancing your cognitive control.  Assess your cognitive control abilities to understand tour strengths and weakness. This will help you understand your attention, working memory and your goal management.</p>

<h4 id="meditation">MEDITATION</h4>

<p>The is good reason to believe that meditation is associated with a wide range of health benefits.</p>

<p>There are two types of home based meditation techniques.</p>

<ol>
<li>Focused attention meditation involves directly focusing on attention on a single object, usually ones breath. Awareness is directed at detecting when this focal point has wandered and then flredirecting it back to s sole focus on the breath.</li>
<li>Open monitoring meditation has no single object of attention. Rather you openly monitor hour thoughts, feelings and sensations from moment to moment without reacting to anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>At their core these are attention exercises.</p>

<h4 id="cognitive-exercise-brain-games">COGNITIVE EXERCISE (Brain Games)</h4>

<p>Mental exercises that involve engaging in repetitive and adaptive interactions with a demanding cognitive task. Usually done through computerized training approaches that integrate an adaptive approach based on performance. The example.they used for attention training was a computer game called Beepseeker where the participant heard there tones and had to correctly identify if a target tone was present among the sistractir tones. Over time the distractir tones moved closer in frequency to the target tone. Making it adaptiveb.</p>

<p>Other mental exercises that can generate positive effects on cognitive control should be designed to challenge working memory and goal managment (both task switching and multitasking).</p>

<h4 id="video-games">VIDEO GAMES</h4>

<p>Interactive media designed to be demanding, adaptive and include lots of feedback. (FPS) Action video games play is critical to force players to juggle a number of varied tasks (detect new enemies, track existing enemies and avoid getting hurt &#8230;) which in turn reduces limitations of several aspects of cognitive control. By playing action video games an hour a day you can improve your ability to detect targets by supeeeeing distractions.</p>

<h4 id="nature">NATURE</h4>

<p>Exposure to nature can relax the mind from its too down demands by engagement with a strong bottom hp activitybwbich captures the attention, not based on goals but  because of the characteristics of the stimuli. Matura environments are inherentlycompelling to us and draw us in with minimal too down responses.</p>

<h4 id="physical-exercise">PHYSICAL EXERCISE</h4>

<p>Aerobic exercise training improves performance on cognitive control tasks. There is a general finding of improved cognitive control for adults strength and aerobic training in groups. The benefits for older adults include all aspects of cognitive control, working memory, attention and foal management. An fMRI study showed greater prefronsl cortex activity in high-fit versus lower-fit older adults while they performed the interference challenge. Aerobic training increases the brain activity if the cprefrontal ortex and also decreases the impact of distraction on task performance.</p>

<h4 id="neurofeedback-training">NEUROFEEDBACK TRAINING</h4>

<p>Manifesting in rhebform of a brain-computer interface that allows the user to gain control over their brain rhythms by receiving real time feedback on how an activity is being modulated when the user thinks in s specific manner.</p>

<h4 id="brain-stimulation">BRAIN STIMULATION</h4>

<p>direct stimulation of the mind with electrical and magnetic fields.</p>

<h3 id="their-conclusions"><strong>THEIR CONCLUSIONS</strong></h3>

<p>Maintain better focus by taking the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Improve metacignition  by increasing your understanding of the cost of multitasking/task switching and the value of remaining at an information patch. (right side)</li>
<li>Limit oaccessibility of information sources. (left side)</li>
<li>Decreas tour boredom when focusing on a single goal. (right side)</li>

<h4 id="strategies-for-completing-assignments">STRATEGIES FOR COMPLETING ASSIGNMENTS</h4>

<ul>
<li>Metacognition &#8211; Recognize the effects that brief interruptions have in your work (they can lead to nearly 30 min off task) It is important for you  you can find a way to track how much time your are spending on task.</li>
<li>Accessibility &#8211; set up your environment to avoid distraction. Limit your self to one screen. Put away all nonessential work materials. Find a quiet environment devoid of people and distractions. If you must work in a noisy environment consider using noise canceling headphones. Close down all apps that you don&#8217;t _need_ to complete a task. Only turn email on for 20-30 minutes st the end of the day.</li>
<li>Boredom &#8211; spend some time standing instead of sitting. Play music that you enjoy to increase your mood while you focus on a single task. Set a time period goal to focus on a task and also set small breaks. Along the way.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tips-for-planning-restorative-stress-reducing-breaks">TIPS FOR PLANNING RESTORATIVE STRESS REDUCING BREAKS</h4>

<ul>
<li>Exercise for at least 15 minutes twice a day.</li>
<li>Train yourself to use the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes focus your eyes on objects 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Expose yourself to nature and get away from technology for ten minutes or so.</li>
<li>Daydream, doodle state into space to take yourself away from performing a specified task. You want to activate the &#8216;default mode network&#8217; of interacting brain areas which indicate that you are daydreaming , thinking creatively or just mind wandering &#8211; all of which are restorative for attention.</li>
<li>Short ten minute naps improve cognitive function. Longer 30 minute naps are good to.</li>
<li>Talking to other human beings reduces stress and improves performance.</li>
<li>Laugh by reading a joke book, comic strip or watching a funny video (of baby goats)</li>
<li>Get some cold refreshing water to drink</li>
<li>Read a chapter of a fiction book</li>

<li>Keep electronics out of the bedroom and turned off for an hour before bedtime.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in as much daylight as you can to regulate your bodies biochemistry</li>
<li>By removing your phone from the room at bedtime it is easy to avoid reaching for it first thing in the morning. By limiting accessibility to your phone you awaken slowly and gradually</li>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m summarizing this from here: <a href="https://medium.com/stanford-alumni/youre-the-fact-checker-now-60103eaeaf3a#.ujkt5csqu">https://medium.com/stanford-alumni/youre-the-fact-checker-now-60103eaeaf3a#.ujkt5csqu</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that I <strong>think</strong>&nbsp;I know things and even more dangerous, I think I do &nbsp;things. Like read something that makes sense and make sure it&#8217;s legit. Or when someone says a numerical figure in conversation it I go verify it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I heard a podcast a whole back and it was about an issue with per reviewed research. The gist of it was that most research only gets done once because the grant money is in novel research. So some researchers figured out a way to reuse those experiments to do novel research. I thought it was pretty cool. The crowd sourced quite few experimented to their peers and found that sometimes the original peer reviewed research couldn&#8217;t be replicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The closer to pure science (physics, math, biology) the more likely it seemed to be repeatable. The hard sciences: psychology and sociology were more.difficult to repeat. To me that seemed like a reflection of how difficult human behavior can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So consuming news on auto-pilot is easy to do because I think that I&#8217;m smart enough to go look up the research and understand it. But when I measure how often I actually do it its a pretty life number.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>THINGS TO DO WHEN CONSUMING THE NEWS.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Answer: who is supplying his info and what&#8217;s their stance?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Answer: how credible is this organization and do they take outside &#8216;funding&#8217;.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Go past the &#8216;about&#8217; page and find references others have made.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Answer: who are their friends.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Answer: who are their enemy&#8217;s and how do they treat them?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s like finding a well used but oddly shaped hammer the previous owner left in the back of a utility closet. The first time you see it you think, &#8216;Hmm I wonder what that hammer is useful for.&#8217; Then you clean out the closet and put the hammer with your other tools. After a while it collects dust and you clean it off on a cold early Saturday morning. At this point you look for a problem to solve with it. The internets and other digital tubes are very useful in this regard these days but you probably don&#8217;t find much, you barely know what it is you are searching for. You may find out the name of it. You may learn about its history and the evolution into what you hold in your hands today.</p>

<p>Then you put it back in the toolbox, make breakfast and talk to your family. After breakfast you do chores and mull on what you learned about the rusty old hammer.</p>

<p>Because if you don&#8217;t get anything done for yourself on the weekends unless its before 7AM you don&#8217;t get to pick up the hammer again until Monday morning when you start the weeks work. But its been on your mind and you look for opportunities to use that new hammer. There are opportunities everywhere. All of your tasks look like nails adapted to be hit by the hammer. So hammer away you do. And by lunch when you look back at the long line of nails in different materials you some that look perfectly pounded but don&#8217;t do anything useful and others, bent and crooked that seem to, just barely, keep everything together. Then as you look back, there is the <strong>One</strong>. The <strong>One</strong> that is perfectly pounded into several different materials and it not only holds them together but it pulls them together in an effortless way that just makes sense.</p>

<p>Taking that <strong>One Experience</strong> away, you reflect on what you were thinking when you worked on it. If you can remember anything at all, it&#8217;s more of a feeling: &#8220;Ok, lets try it this way and then move on to the next task.&#8221; <strong>This Way</strong> ends up being pretty useful and sometimes elegant. <strong>This Way</strong> is something you can take forward as you attack your forest of nails.</p>

<p>I am testing myself on some personal learning topics and here are my Q &amp; A&#8217;s. Underlined words indicate an area I need to investigate and understand better. Study was mainly done <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">here</a></p>

<h4 id="what-is-tree-traversal">WHAT IS TREE TRAVERSAL?</h4>

<p>Tree traversal in this context is the programmatic visitation to nodes in a tree. In my mind is a BST with data and left and right pointers. The process that a program uses to visit and perform computation on the trees nodes is tree traversal.</p>

<h4 id="when-performing-tree-traversal-what-steps-are-available-for-the-program-to-process-all-nodes">WHEN PERFORMING TREE TRAVERSAL WHAT STEPS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE PROGRAM TO PROCESS ALL NODES?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Answer the question &#8220;Are both of this nodes left and right pointers null?&#8221;</li>
<li>Process the nodes data</li>
<li>Traverse to the left node and repeat</li>
<li>Traverse the right node and repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>Except for the null check, the steps can be performed in any order.</p>

<h4 id="what-strategies-exist-for-traversing-all-bst-tree-nodes-and-how-do-they-work">WHAT STRATEGIES EXIST FOR TRAVERSING ALL BST TREE NODES AND HOW DO THEY WORK?</h4>

<p>Given the following designations for operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>(N) Process node N</li>
<li>(L) recursively traverse the left sub tree</li>
<li>&reg; recursively traverse the right sub tree</li>
</ul>

<p>There are four types of traversals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Post Order traversal when at Node N

<ul>
<li> Check if N is empty or null</li>
<li>(L) recursively traverse the left subtree and end up back at N</li>
<li>&reg; recursively traverse the right subtree and end up back at N</li>
<li>(N) process the node N</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In Order Traversal when at Node N

<ul>
<li>Check if N is empty or null</li>
<li>(L) recursively traverse the left subtree and end up back at N</li>
<li>(N) process the node N</li>
<li>&reg; recursively traverse the right subtree and end up back at N</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pre Order traversal when at Node N

<ul>
<li>Check if N is empty or null</li>
<li>(N) process the node N</li>
<li>(L) recursively traverse the left subtree and end up back at N</li>
<li>&reg; recursively traverse the right subtree and end up back at N</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breadth First Search (BFS)

<ul>
<li>A strategy that visits each level of a BST, progressively getting deeper and processing each level</li>
<li>Implementation is through Queue</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="types-of-problems">TYPES OF PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>Each traversal strategy is adept at solving certain problems.</p>

<h5 id="pre-order">PRE-ORDER</h5>

<p>Can be used to duplicate nodes and edges to make a duplicate binary tree. For expression trees it can be used to make a prefix expression (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">polish notation</span>)</p>

<h5 id="in-order">IN-ORDER</h5>

<p>Binary search trees commonly use in-order traversal. In-order traversal returns the values from the underlying set (in order) according to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">comparator</span> that that set up the BST.</p>

<h5 id="post-order">POST-ORDER</h5>

<p>Post-order traversal, while deleting or freeing nodes and values, can delete or free an entire binary tree. It can also generate a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">postfix representation</span> of the binary tree.</p>

            <description>Anyone can be a leader and everyone should lead something. We are all professionals and experts at the things we do most.
From what I see, the best leaders are always learning. They ask questions, teach them selves new things and effectively identify those in the next generation with the most fearless voices. The ones who are optimistic that anything can happen. Anything at all.&amp;nbsp;
As a parent I struggle to ride the line between efficiency and wading through all of the noise that my next generation emits and letting her explore and broadcast her way to where I need her to be.</description>

<p>As a parent I struggle to ride the line between efficiency and wading through all of the noise that my next generation emits and letting her explore and broadcast her way to where I need her to be. She does have a lot of noise but as she grows I see and hear novel ideas that I didn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t have. There is clarity in her purpose to see and know EVERYTHING.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leaders who know that they are dumb in the grand scheme of things, the ones who know they have tons of room to learn, those are the ones who will cultivate and grow the best ideas for the next generation.</p>

            <description>Hannah was helping me make frosting today and I tried to get her to use the mixer. Because, you and I know it&amp;#8217;s faster. She kept saying no so, hey it xmas eve and there is no hurry.&amp;nbsp;
I probed a bit because it was obvious to me that the matchine was faster and more efficient at mixing the food coloring into the frosting. &amp;#8220;It does it to fast she said.</description>

<p>I probed a bit because it was obvious to me that the matchine was faster and more efficient at mixing the food coloring into the frosting. &#8220;It does it to fast she said. I want to watch it mix.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Huh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It does it to fast and it&#8217;s fun to watch the food coloring mix into the white frosting. What a reminder to be fascinated by the little things. An example of how faster isn&#8217;t always better because the mixer blends so fast I was missing out on the streaks of white and color that spiraled in. The gradients in the color as darker and lighter parts average into a smooth shade of green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I may be the teacher but I have much to learn. She (re)taught me that in order to better understand something you need to slow it down so you can better study it. You need to connect with it in order to understand and perhaps even manipulate it. Animation is like this.</p>

<p>I was proud though, she did get her mom to &#8216;help&#8217; her mix one of them and she did one by herself.</p>

            <description>Your Problem So you have a link thats a phone number. You have this because you want the link to auto dial when on a phone but look like text and not have any functionality when on a screen larger than a phone. As an engineer you don&amp;#8217;t want to duplicate html to provide this feature and would love if css had a way to encapsulate this on one place.</description>

<h3 id="your-problem">Your Problem</h3>

<p>So you have a link thats a phone number. You have this because you want the link to auto dial when on a phone but look like text and not have any functionality when on a screen larger than a phone. As an engineer you don&#8217;t want to duplicate html to provide this feature and would love if css had a way to encapsulate this on one place. What can we do?</p>

<p>Try something like this:</p>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="css" data-enlighter-theme="minimal">a {
  @include rem(font-size, 16px);

  @include media('&lt;tablet') {
    @include rem(font-size, 12px);
  }

  @include media("&gt;=tablet") {
    &[href^="tel"]{
      cursor: default;
      pointer-events: none;
    }
  }

  @include media("&lt;tablet") {
    &[href^="tel"]{
      text-decoration: underline!important;
    }
  }
}</pre>

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="minimal">&lt;a href="tel:800-123-4567"&gt;(800) 123-4567&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>This is sass and I am using sass-rem for typography and include-media for media queries.</p>

<p>From one of the masters: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/" target="_blank"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/">https://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/</a></a></p>

<p>And if you are using sass, run</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$ bower install sass-rem -S</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on your command line. The -S is a shortcut to save the dependency. now you can generate font-size rems with fallbacks. The project is here: <a href="https://github.com/pierreburel/sass-rem">https://github.com/pierreburel/sass-rem</a>.</p>

            <description>I have always loved good music. I&amp;#8217;ve heard some good songs of this time and I still love it when I come across timeless lyrics like this:
 Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
pour another glass of that rock and roll
 I&amp;#8217;m a long way from the mid 90&amp;#8217;s Cleveland metal scene. &amp;nbsp;Boy! Man o man did it train my ear to find the good sounds in the sonically oversaturated internet world of 2015.</description>

<p>I&#8217;m a long way from the mid 90&#8217;s Cleveland metal scene. &nbsp;Boy! Man o man did it train my ear to find the good sounds in the sonically oversaturated internet world of 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love my rock and roll because it can be soooo, so, so, so many things. It can be time less. Sometimes its the people and the moment that the movement requires. The moment seeded correctly, nurtured carefully and then grown into a movement that sticks around for a generation or two. And forever in some minds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So kick out your jams. Pour your glass and rock and roll when you can. &nbsp;Some moments are only memorable because they happen for the first time once. Live it. Because, in that space there is room for your soul. Which I believe to be a collection of memories that are created in the first moments of new discovery and pursued anew again forever more. They last forever but are uniq. (Misspelled on purpose)</p>

  Life is a cycle and this is something I used to say to Hannah when she let me walk her into the schoolyard. The sketch below was an idea I jotted down about how to visualize life in a personal context.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  We start our cycles and learn whats fun and not fun. We learn how to work so that some things are more fun. We try to achieve a dream. We fail. If we are lucky we learn from the failures and keep dreaming. Once day we we find ourselves wishing something for someone else and hoping that they understand how to get there. We try to help then because its fun and we learn that when you teach, you are still a student.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The path we chose to walk follows cycles and everyone should be so lucky to find good people that they can say something like &#8220;Hugs, kisses & I love you too!&#8221;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The web is an infinite canvas. Anyone can create a page with a bit of html and even make it look nice with some css. Word processors are infinite canvases &amp;#8211; just open up a new page and you can write whatever you want to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The web is an infinite canvas. Anyone can create a page with a bit of html and even make it look nice with some css. Word processors are infinite canvases &#8211; just open up a new page and you can write whatever you want to.</p>

<h3 id="the-mind-is-an-infinite-canvas">The Mind Is An Infinite Canvas</h3>

<p>We start this young. Every child has been told that they can do and be anything they want. And they can. The human mind is an amazing organ capable of adapting and re-shaping itself time and time again. True, it takes more effort as it ages.</p>

<p>So what stops us from creating a compelling web page or writing that awe inspiring book? What keeps up from re-inventing ourselves at the intersections of the many stages we live through? I believe one of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of ability to identify and set constraints. For ourselves individually, for the projects and groups we work with. For the companies we want to build.</p>

<h3 id="constraints-spur-creativity">Constraints Spur Creativity</h3>

<p>Arbitrarily putting yourself in a box makes that infinite white canvas a little less daunting. And when it boxes you in it forces you to find a way around it when those certain situations call for it.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to take a stand. You feel that you have no choice but to &amp;#8216;draw a line in the sand.&amp;#8217; This line is a dangerous thing. As with all things of last resort it can inflict as much damage on yourself as it can those whom you are trying to protect yourself from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall  when Gandalf broke the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers&#34;&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/a&gt;, it did not end well for him. But he saved his friends and things worked out. I like this, its ideal but if I have learned anything these past years is that the &lt;strong&gt;real world and the ideal one inside my head have very little in common. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you have to take a stand. You feel that you have no choice but to &#8216;draw a line in the sand.&#8217; This line is a dangerous thing. As with all things of last resort it can inflict as much damage on yourself as it can those whom you are trying to protect yourself from.</p>

<p>If you recall  when Gandalf broke the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers">The Two Towers</a>, it did not end well for him. But he saved his friends and things worked out. I like this, its ideal but if I have learned anything these past years is that the <strong>real world and the ideal one inside my head have very little in common. </strong></p>

<p>When I was younger I was prone to acting without thinking (emotionally). This led to many a time when I would draw ideal lines in the sand for one reason or the other &#8211; and then I would stick to it. Even if that meant cutting my nose off to spite my face, dammit I had my idealized world that I knew was right. Slowly it dawned on me that the real world doesn&#8217;t really care about the ideal world I created for it.</p>

<p>The other thing that comes when you draw your line and take a stand and say no more X, Y and Z is that sometimes you get what you want. There are consequences to this. Most of which you can&#8217;t anticipate ahead of time. So in getting what you wanted, you also inherit all of the things to come when the world moves on. Maybe people don&#8217;t want to work with you later because you made their life more difficult by your stand taking. Maybe something else &#8230; life is complicated.</p>

<p>So what to do? Have more <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html">strong opinions, weakly held</a>. I don&#8217;t know where I first heard this but it is something I think about when I am considering drawing a line in the sand. It reminds me of what is most important to me and I can use it to question the foundations of beliefs underlying my opinions. This is a chance to put myself in the shoes or situation that is causing me to want to draw the line. By standing in their shoes I can objectively question my assumptions and understand their mindset. Sometimes this will only reinforce my position. But, it forces me to take a deep breath and think before I reach for the stick I&#8217;ll need to use to draw the line. In thinking there may be a better, less damaging way to move forward without drawing a line that forces everyone  to choose a side. Once people choose a side they are either for you or against you. If they are against you it will be very difficult to work with them in the future. And life never stops, wheels turn and all that so perhaps its better to modify my (ideal) opinions instead of forcing them onto the real world.</p>]]></content>

<p>A whiskey infused customer support request to try and get iTunes movie rentals to work on my aging iPad mini mini. &nbsp;-MattH</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s get a few thing onto the table. This is not the first time I&#8217;ve had this problem. But, I am the typical white male American from rural enough America who made it well enough off to be able to complain about first world problems. Heck, the fact that I get to complain from my first gen iPad mini is evidence enough to of my entitlement. If you want more evidence of it, how about this:having grown up listening to the Eagles and Credence Clear Water Revival on my factory working fathers hard earned radio, I now have to resort to listening to yelowolf and whining online because the mindless movie I tried to download didn&#8217;t work, again. Queue up the tiny purple violin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The movie I&#8217;m trying to download it for the past few hours will help me disconnect me from the start up I work at and the decidedly first world employment problems I had today. I know, it&#8217;s tragi. Given the fact that my wife is smarter than me. I get paid more than her to fiddle th bits on high rsolutin screns while over zealous police shoot to protect instead of diplomatically serve as diplomat and diffuse the situation. You would think that I would be able to place my &#8216;problems&#8217; into a proper context.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But really, that stuff doesn&#8217;t matter. And I have to say, it&#8217;s your fault. Apple. If only, iff only you already sold that iPad pro I would have bought one and be happily watching the rents movie Jupiter Ascending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I hear you. Sng yea childe of self entitlement. I would have bought the newer device and I am sure that renting a movie would be seemless and easy and just work. Because right now, after the day I had &#8211; first world entitlement and all &#8230; I just want some mindless storytelling to decompress with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must also know that I have had the privilege of a few glasses of whiskey on the rocks (goes great with the yelowolf and &#8216;have a great flight&#8217;) and will unfortunately resort to working on my app that solves all my visualization / system modeling problems and prolly yours too &#8211; all with the interesting Swift language features that I hope you improve next week wrt Xcode. I know, I know. I hear you, first world problems and self entitlement and all of that. We got it on the table already so let&#8217;s lea it there while we talk. Then, you can ignore my whining. No worries I&#8217;ll easily be able to get a refund when get the iTunes recipe in my email inbox.</p>

<p>Worst case, this rental issue keeps happenng until you open that fancy new spaceship of yours and I finally apply to be a code monkey to help you solve this problem. But maybe not, wwdc is next week and I hear that you have a priority on making your software work well on older devices. Maybe, I hope so. Because I just really wants mindless entertainment tonight and it didn&#8217;t just work.&nbsp;</p>

            <description>Here is an odd turn of events. I have been saving for a nice pair of headphones (Shure 535&amp;#8217;s) and decided to get a mini amp (Fiio &amp;#8211; Mont Blanc) since phone&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t have the power to do them justice.
The amp is nicely crafted with brushed aluminum for its enclosure. To turn it on and control volume there is a knob with a rough but pleasant to touch texture. It has a satisfying click and I find myself envying the control over volume more than with the rockers on the phones that I have used since as long as my memory goes back for that kind of thing.</description>

I have been saving for a nice pair of headphones (<a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/se-earphones/se535ltd-sound-isolating-earphones">Shure 535&#8217;s</a>) and decided to get a mini amp (<a href="http://www.fiio.net/en/products/33">Fiio &#8211; Mont Blanc</a>) since phone&#8217;s don&#8217;t have the power to do them justice.</p>

<p>The amp is nicely crafted with brushed aluminum for its enclosure. To turn it on and control volume there is a knob with a rough but pleasant to touch texture. It has a satisfying click and I find myself envying the control over volume more than with the rockers on the phones that I have used since as long as my memory goes back for that kind of thing.</p>

<p>This input control is a throwback for me because the phone has completely replaced anything else as my music player. It&#8217;s been several years since I used a real, not the svg version of a, knob to control volume. I wonder if its the act of grasping the rough machined edges of the knob and turning that adds to my experience? Coupled to that and somewhere deep in the ancient recessed of my memory is fiddling with the audio systems that my dad had when I was a kid. I remember when he first hooked them up to video setup we had then and we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/synopsis">Time Bandits</a>. Still epic in my memory. The sound was awesome and I remember that more than the crappy crt tv that it played on.</p>

<p>Can / will / should-  digital ever be able to replace that kind of experience? Or, as the dependence on physical things like amps wanes, will the digital equivalents find there way into the next generation and they make memories with their own experiences?</p>

            <description>I have been having issues with my trackpad and bluetooth keyboard reconnecting to after I wake up from a sleep session. Only twice now but the same thing. Instead of restarting (which will fix it) you can drop into the command line and run these two commands:
  sudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport
  sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport

            <description>I believe that we all have ideas. Some good, some different and some that are meh. Together we can assemble ideas that can solve the biggest of problems. These pieces of the puzzle are more difficult to mine than diamonds and gold but are infinitely more valuable when we put them together in a variety of ways with other ideas from like minded folks.&amp;nbsp;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a weird layout issue with the Bootstrap 3 Grid this morning. After three attempts that ended in failure, on way or the other I was something. Frustrated, pissed, annoyed are words that come close to the feeling, but they are not quite right. English is a funny language and sometimes not quite descriptive enough for the more subtle emotions that wash over you from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a break. On the Twitter I saw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/the-quitter&#34;&gt;Virgin twitter feed post&lt;/a&gt; to this. It helped 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Just sit still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing else. No thought. No feeling. No movement. Well you must breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Start with 29 seconds. Why 29? Episode 29 was a cool thing to see when I was a freshman in high school. But that&amp;#8217;s not why 29 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Nothing else. No thought. No feeling. No movement. Well you must breath.</p>

<p>Ok. Start with 29 seconds. Why 29? Episode 29 was a cool thing to see when I was a freshman in high school. But that&#8217;s not why 29 seconds.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not quite 30 which is one half. And it&#8217;s way past 0. It adds up to eleven and then ends with the highest single digit integer that we know of. It makes perfect sense. Right?</p>

<p>Ok, that&#8217;s enough nostalgic trivia for you to walk back in time a bit for things that lead me to begin sitting still early in the morning and late at night. Depending on which side of the pillow I was.</p>

<p>Through the years, the best thing about having a hard time sleeping is the quiet. Quiet time, quiet sounds, still moments where anything can happen. The day either has not yet completed, leaving a bit of time for anything to happen. Or, its moments after staring anew and everything is on the horizon. You may also understand if you have ever ridden through the trees of a mountain glen while it&#8217;s snowing. Or stood amidst frozen trees on a moonlight night while the wind blows through the forest. That&#8217;s one is cool. Well cold and it may get a little creepy but there is something in that quiet that you can&#8217;t find anywhere else.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t finished my book. I&#8217;m an average engineer on my best days and I never landed a 720, back when I cared landing them and before my knee started talking to me.</p>

<p>I have learned to be happy. Getting a chance to do <strong>The Hardest Thing You Will Ever Do</strong> is the one thing that everyone gets. It&#8217;s the thing that will make the biggest difference, in the long run.</p>

<p>Just sit still.</p>]]></content>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Notes to self &amp; advice to those working in Angular 1.x Land. If you don&#8217;t want to read <a title="this" href="http://www.jvandemo.com/the-nitty-gritty-of-compile-and-link-functions-inside-angularjs-directives/" target="_blank">this</a>, here are three elevator pitch points to consider when understanding directives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the <code>compile</code> function to change the original DOM (template element) before AngularJS creates an instance of it and before a scope is created.

<ol>
<li>Use the <code>pre-link</code> function to implement logic that runs when AngularJS has already compiled the child elements, but before any of the child element&#8217;s <code>post-link</code> functions have been called.</li>
<li>Use the <code>post-link</code> function to execute logic, knowing that all child elements have been compiled and all <code>pre-link</code> and <code>post-link</code> functions of child elements have been executed.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>I disavow any credit for the three points above. <a href="https://twitter.com/jvandemo">@<span class="u-linkComplex-target">jvandemo</span></a>{.ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink.u-linkComplex.js-nav} wrote the clear and excellent piece above. This is just my summary of his summary on the article which you ignored if you are reading this far 🙂 This post is mainly for a reference at my fingertips later on in the future when I need to real it.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Early morning thought for more exploration at some point:
Go right up to the line. Study it, learn about its history and why its where it is at that moment. Then, press your index finger up against it and see how it responds. Is it stretchy and membrane like? is it porous or brittle? Does it deliver an electric shock to your system? You won&amp;#8217;t know if you never try to cross the line.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that some are worried that there is all this really important data hidden in spreadsheets and tied to an app and an OS. And that data may not be parsible in fifty or a hundred years. And that may be so. But, our knowledge is still passed on in the oral tradition. And now it&amp;#8217;s an easily persists or audio visual tradition. It&amp;#8217;s funny, how the more things change, technology, the more they stay the same, good story telling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We add to it everyday. While I still think photos from a Dslr are better than the phones, the phones near ubiquity means that I can tell my story and persist it as is. Up load to my server and snapshot it once a month. Take precaution with a simple backup and make sure Hannah can find and use the keys. I believe that&#8217;s more important, right now. More important than mining all my spreadsheets for data. What I am lacking is an audio visual tool to annotate things that are important to me. A way to color the layers for those who listen tomorrow.</p>]]></content>

The accomplishment of many goals, this is your application or service. Avoid building the service to fit the people using it. Build it and evolve it to fit the accomplishments.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Three quotes from the (Audio) book: &lt;a href=&#34;http://makeitstick.net&#34;&gt;Make It Stick:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourages deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its better to attempt a solution and supply an incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three quotes from the (Audio) book: <a href="http://makeitstick.net">Make It Stick:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourages deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied.</li>
<li>Its better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution.</li>
<li>Its better to attempt a solution and supply an incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it weird that I here this in Yoda&#8217;s voice, followed up by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means to me is that we are infinitely capable of doing things. But we have to start doing them. Mastery and self-confidence are not required to do something better, new, differently. Rather, it is making up your mind to &#8216;Just do it.&#8217; and ten keep on doing it. Persevering through unsuccessful problem solving attempts instead of memorizing or watching someone else solve a similar or same problem is move valuable in the long run that the solution you seek.</p>

<p>The journey is more valuable than the destination. By fighting through headwinds you gain mastery and self confidence that lasts longer than just the solution to any one problem.</p>

<p>This is true in all things. Creating things with software engineering at all levels: small projects to giant organizations. Athletics, marriage, parenthood and everything else that people do are things we choose to do for a variety of reasons. Either way each one is a series of problems to solve and only by solving them incorrectly at first can we solve related problems with mastery and self confidence later on.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Thoughts from Hannah on 12-17-2014
 My favorite part of the story was when the reindeer nudged Teeka on the cheek. This was my favorite part of the story, because I would like to have a nudge from a reindeer. If I were Teeka, I would be really nice to the reindeer all the time. If I were one of the reindeer I would listen to Teeka all the time.</description>

            <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-it-stick-the-science-of-successful-learning&#34;&gt;Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a book about recent advances in understanding the science of learning and questions some of the assumptions you may have. This stands out since I seem to have started 2015 off with an understanding and using failure theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful learners who interpret failure to learn something as the result of insufficient effort or an ineffective strategy will more often dig deeper by asking more questions and using what the learn to try different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Is a book about recent advances in understanding the science of learning and questions some of the assumptions you may have. This stands out since I seem to have started 2015 off with an understanding and using failure theme.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Successful learners who interpret failure to learn something as the result of insufficient effort or an ineffective strategy will more often dig deeper by asking more questions and using what the learn to try different approaches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you fail, decide if its because you did not apply yourself enough or, if you used the wrong tools and resources to guide your approach. Then, compile a list of questions as appropriate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did my tools (programming language of choice, stack overflow, books, sample apps) limit my approach or distract me from what I was really trying to master?</li>
<li>Did my tools hide some of the more complicated fundamentals that one must understand to master this?</li>
<li>Was I just lazy because shopping is so much easier than learning hard things?</li>
<li>Was I lazy because I failed to set a regular time/place for practicing this?</li>
<li>How could I build regular but asymmetric practice into my routines?</li>
</ul>

<p>Honest answers to questions like  these will guide your introspection and help you plan to try again.</p>]]></content>

            <description>No, not the band. But I do hope they put a new album out this year.
Failure as in, &amp;#8216;define my success by the things I have failed trying to do.&amp;#8217;
Failure as in, &amp;#8216;if I have not failed at something today, then I&amp;#8217;m not challenging myself.&amp;#8217;
Failure as is, &amp;#8216;we grow and learn the most when we struggle and fail to easily succeed at something.&amp;#8217;
Forget failing fast. Just try many things and plan to fail at most of them.</description>

            <description>I bought a pack of gum because it was titled &amp;#8220;Ascent.&amp;#8221; Since its wintertime and Mt. Baldy is collecting snow it made sense to me that that was the right pack of gum for me. They have a marketing gimmick for truth or dare and these two truth questions stood out for me:
 Question:
Would you rather fly or drive across the country?
Answer:
Drive &amp;#8211; its more scenic, less stressful than airports and only has the con of needing to make personal time to do it.</description>

<p>Stargaze. Space is cool and there may be birds on other planets.</p>

            <description>I saw a quote from the Facebook CEO:
 What, you think because you&amp;#8217;re paying Apple that you&amp;#8217;re somehow in alignment with them?
 Despite the admiration that has grown on me wrt how Facebook is lead and some of the things they are doing, my opinion of a company built solely around advertising is not based on how I think I align with them. It&amp;#8217;s how I think they align with me.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw a quote from the Facebook CEO:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite the admiration that has grown on me wrt how Facebook is lead and some of the things they are doing, my opinion of a company built solely around advertising is not based on how I think I align with them. It&#8217;s how I think they align with me. So anyone who offers me free mindless Internet lulz, ala the two OG big boys of search and social, has much more alignment with the folks who want to know about me. If Facebook and Google really wanted to align with customers more than advertisers they would offer me a paid model and guarantee they my information was private, secure and 100% safe from anyone, even their employees. A PCI level one account that would let me interact with the people I want to interact with without anyone else involved in the transfer of the data I generate. Oh yes, as part of the paid model they would also ask to pay me for any of the content I generated.</p>

<p>I guessing here but this is not a technical limitations for either of the two leaders in search and social. What is sad is that most folks don&#8217;t have the time or technical acumen to do it themselves. It&#8217;s really not that hard. If you can do basic car or house repair you are smart enough to run a WordPress site on digital ocean. So they default to the lowest common denominator and tell themselves a story that can justify the enormous time and resource drain the free service provides.</p>

<p>Idk, search and social has to get a lot more brittle before it becomes irrelevant but I wish, I wish, Santa I wish they would offer me a reasonable paid option to be removed from the data sets they package up and sell. Apple asks me to pay this cost upfront and so I form the opinion that they are in alignment with me. As soon as their products and services make my life more difficult than a competitors they know I&#8217;ll switch. It&#8217;s just personal business decision. With search and social, meh, why should I invest my creativity and energy when there are more important and interesting problems to solve.</p>

<p>Like how will my grandchildren a grandchildren discover things about me? How can I archive and curate my digital self such that they can have a conversation with me long after I have stopped generating digital footprints?</p>

            <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t know who said it when I was growing up, but, it has held true for me as I walk along this path.  “Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Asking the wrong question is expensive. It eats up time, creates unintended problems with cascading consequences and exhausts your energy. We are looking at appetizing our themes at work. Our themes are simple angular apps that depend on a toolbox of things related to the api, business logic and the desire to provide some out of the box components that just work. For the uninitiated Angular developer this lets them focus on the style and presentation of the app and spend time where they are more comfortable, with the scss (or css if they nee to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h4 id="red-herrings">Red Herrings</h4>

<p>My opinions and pre conceptions limit the possible solutions and can keep me trying to solve the wrong problem in the wrong way. When the requirement was presented I was skeptical, because I knew a little bit about this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/bootstrap">Note: You should not use the ng-app directive when manually bootstrapping your app.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That made me assume you cannot inject other apps as dependency&#8217;s into other angular apps. Despite knowing how bower_components are (manually) injected into the app. So I read all the way down to there again and went on my way looking for ideas on how to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inject  and config a second angular app into a running angular app; despite the fact that it is very clear that this is not possible</li>
<li>Bootstrap one angular app with the same instance or a reference to dependencies from another so I didn&#8217;t have to worry about intra-app communication and other things related to how we are using the services</li>
</ol>

<p>Red herrings can help you by leading you on paths you didn&#8217;t know about but they can also harm you by locking yourself into limitations that don&#8217;t really exist.</p>

<h4 id="reflection-in-progress">Reflection In Progress</h4>

<p>Neither of these things was what I needed to do. And it would have helped to reflect more on what I needed to do rather than how I thought it should be done. How I think things should be done are intimately tied to my opinions and preconceptions. Reflecting critically and often will help the honest person balance the pro&#8217;s and cons that Red Herrings provide while asking the right questions.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m following the progress of Zurb&amp;#8217;s Foundation For Apps. They have published some ideas related to erasing the difference between native mobile apps and web apps on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m following the progress of Zurb&#8217;s Foundation For Apps. They have published some ideas related to erasing the difference between native mobile apps and web apps on a mobile device.</p>

<p>As I plan the interface for OnReMe I&#8217;m interested in using native browser tools to create the building blocks of an app that can be reused, content and API back-end independent. Much of what I have experienced in the first jQuery, then iOS and currently AngulerJS development cycles is that creating your UI depends on the data. I can make all the pretty mock ups I want. But, until I have fungible data to kick around in the app I don&#8217;t really know what I don&#8217;t know. This means that pretty design ideas, while important if the API isn&#8217;t ready yet, must remain flexible and evolve dynamically as the understanding of the service that access to the data provides. Because I don&#8217;t know things like implementation specific business rules that affect view structure, I need a general app framework that stays flexible as I put different things into it. Motion, Animation and smooth transitions are a big part of the boilerplate things that need to be used effectively to make an app feel native int the device browser.</p>

<p>Here is a quick sketch of some ideas I have collected and am curating on one of my trello boards:</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest digital virus going around the internets caught up with me this past weekend and team Mack tagged me as one of their &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; So, I had my lovely assistant help me with the challenge and with her advice I pass it on to Barbi, Jasmine and Raquelle. Good thing it was warm and pleasant here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy cold showers but this was more like a polar bear swim. I think Hannah enjoyed pouring the H2O over my head though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs on problem solving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don’t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it’s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s sort of the middle, and that’s where most people stop… But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem — and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>So it would seem that I&#8217;m in the middle of faceted search. It just has so many facets to making an initiative flow to narrow in on a customers desire. Pardon the facet pun. Here are a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loosely defined association between the products queried for and the facets returned</li>
<li>The relationship between the URL and the user selections as they narrow the result set</li>
<li>The programatic and business case for building it in such a way that it can be used and reused in the same theme or a different theme with only style or view changes to the directive</li>
<li>The prototypal nature of the toolbox&#8217;s origins</li>
<li>The desire to document toolboxes design, dependencies and pathways so it is clearly understood and simple to use</li>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The intersection between computers and their intelligence connects the most complicated problems for a new intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The intersection between computers and their intelligence connects the most complicated problems for a new intelligence.</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0434.png"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0434.png" alt="IMG_0434.PNG" /></a></p>

<!--more-->

<p>Anyone with this in their playlist would find this:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0436.png"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0436.png" alt="IMG_0436.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>If I ask you to play something, then bad spelling and all I want the song to play. I don&#8217;t care how it&#8217;s spelled. Momma and Mama are recognizable by a second grader. Computers will have to do this too. From the six year olds I talk to, I&#8217;m sure Momma would be reported to authority figures as mis-spelled . There you go. She is six. She is correct. And she is on her way to being very smart.</p>

<p>So clearly the two are the same thing. And the computer in my pocket connected to the most powerful networks ever still needs permission to search the internet for pop culture news related to a song Mama Sed. Anyone who knows me, like it hope my personal AI would should be able to find the song I mean.</p>]]></content>

            <description>From Anatidae&amp;#8217;s comment on the web:
  If you&amp;#8217;re messing with the DOM, do it in a directive If you&amp;#8217;re modifying your data, do it in your controllers or services.  If you&amp;#8217;re defining data, do it in a factory.   Also, the faster you forget about jQuery, the faster you will be productive building an Angular app. You can always bring it back later if you still want to and you may run into in in disguise in one of your directives.</description>

<p>Keep focusing on the mobile device clients. It won&#8217;t be just teaching Spanish and classes. Big Co and friends will distribute the culture and tools that drive business forward. Bonus points will go to those who can create those tools and those who use them efficiently. Extra credit goes to those who can remix the tools provided into new tools as the organization evolves.</p>

<p>Native isn&#8217;t going away, no matter how much I like angular and friends for the web. It can&#8217;t hurt to be able to use both mediums.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Revolutionary gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary keeps you moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what, you think different. So does everyone else. If we all think different, all the time there will be billions of little revolutions that spark, flare up and flame out. The flare ups that evolve into consuming a fuel source are the ones that change everything. They transform the landscape as they go through their lifecycle. Everything has a lifecycle: businesses, ideas and organisms alike. &amp;#8220;Whatever it is, we all go through it&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latyrx&#34;&gt;Latyrix&lt;/a&gt; (I think)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>As businesses, they take decades or centuries to flame out. Because, they evolve to adapt and consume fuel efficiently instead of all at once. As ideas they have lasted thousands of years so far. The good ideas in our species seem to propagate from generation to generation and from location to location in poorly misunderstood ways that, while easily observable, are poorly understood. But they do survive and migrate. As they do the rough edges get worn down and the surface gets polished and then the idea gets passed along.</p>

<p>We need both. And we need to learn to recognize both in out thoughts. Most of our revolutionary thoughts are not for the real world. If we recognize the ones that are and can evolve them properly, together revolution &amp; evolution change everything.</p>]]></content>

Focus, and stay perfectly still.
Focus, calm your mind.
Rest your body. And go to sleep. A smile does wonders for the reception of my delivery.  Lay down still.
Close your eyes, and rest.

            <title>ORM Design</title>

            <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;arguments&#34;&gt;Arguments&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping&#34;&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt;. Well not at the technical level I would expect to find myself at. It strikes me as odd that this is not more urgent for me. We have all the tools to, whats the phrase, turn the tables? Close, but not quite right. While fully acknowledging the inherit risks we should embrace the ability of our devices to track stuff. We can use it to our advantage, with a little help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h5 id="arguments">Arguments</h5>

<p>No, not this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>. Well not at the technical level I would expect to find myself at. It strikes me as odd that this is not more urgent for me. We have all the tools to, whats the phrase, turn the tables? Close, but not quite right. While fully acknowledging the inherit risks we should embrace the ability of our devices to track stuff. We can use it to our advantage, with a little help.</p>

<p>Think about the character Eminem plays in 8 Mile. Always the underdog trying to figure the system out. His moment of zen, or ken is when he works out what he needs to say ahead of the final showdown. He knows what the opponents are going to say. It&#8217;s already out there. The zen is that he switches his mind from thinking about how to attack the other rapper and just use &#8216;what everyone knows&#8217; and &#8216;common assumption&#8217; to his advantage.</p>

<p>Sure, the algorithms today can be pretty accurate. But they can&#8217;t be emotional and they can&#8217;t be right all the time. The value is in identifying when they are wrong and using the information to your advantage. Big company&#8217;s have been collecting data on use for a long time. Since before the internet exploded. The internet explosion has enabled them to &#8216;do more with less&#8217; and other such things that translate into spend marketing dollars for an efficient and substantial return on investment. But they don&#8217;t give us that data back and they surely (I truly hope) share it with others who do give us some of that data back.</p>

<p>So whats a poor non-technical human to do? How does one &#8216;attack&#8217; them with whats already out there? OnReMe is a personal spider that follows you around, connects the threads and weaves a web of behavior that you can see. So what does OnReMe need to start?</p>

<h5 id="a-list-of-sources">A List of Sources</h5>

<ul>
<li>Web Browsing: all major browsers</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Websites: Personal (blog)</li>
<li>Websites: eCommerce (What I shop for &amp; buy)</li>
<li>Websites: news (What I read)</li>
<li>Websites: engaged (forums, &#8216;discussion&#8217;)</li>
<li>Crafted: This is what I see and hear in my head, about myself)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="design">Design</h5>

<p>What is the on boarding process? One has to want to create an image of themselves. This means Crafted is first and easy and flexible. Perhaps give it rudimentary export functionality: pdf and an angular app that can be hosted somewhere. The other parts are where the long term value lives. I know where I go, what interests me. I also know that when I go to those places, omg &#8211; they are tracking me. Yes, yes, yes. As idealistic as that battles sounds I would rather spend time with my family and think about how to &#8216;turn the tables&#8217; with the system as is today.</p>

<p>Next, once there is small value in crafting my image and projecting that message out to whoever, I can pull in the other stuff and use that to refine and enhance the message for a particular channel. This is where Orm the personal spider comes in. She follows you around, connects the dots and helps you collect whats most important to you. This is OnReMe by design.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;There are guidelines to everything under the sun. Getting what you want, where you want, how you want is just another process that we all go through. It can always be done differently but the savvy folks learn to look at the lessons learned by those who traveled before them and apply their lessons appropriately. These are guidelines. With that said, Keep these in mind when you are designing your path:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It can always be done differently but the savvy folks learn to look at the lessons learned by those who traveled before them and apply their lessons appropriately. These are guidelines. With that said, Keep these in mind when you are designing your path:</p>

<ol>
<li>The system was destroyed last night. Today is an opportunity for you to rebuild it in a way that suites you best.

<ol>
<li>Focus on what you would like if you could have whatever is ideal for you; do not focus on what you want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span>.</li>
<li>When someone disagrees with you, understand why they disagree and learn what they would do differently.</li>
<li>Focus on smaller focused changes as they can be controlled in the &#8216;real world.&#8217;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind the following; outside of an organizational structure where rules, etiquette and purpose are mutually agreed upon, the really real world will over only the easy feedback. This is easy but to improve on it you will have to fix it for yourself.</p>

<h5 id="make-a-mess-clean-it-up-http-www-folklore-org-storyview-py-story-make-a-mess-clean-it-up-txt"><a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Make_a_Mess,_Clean_it_Up!.txt">Make a mess, clean it up.</a></h5>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Instead of avoiding the tough situations, he&#8217;d immediately create them, and immediately start learning how to handle the worst situation imaginable. Pretty soon he would routinely handle anything the machine could throw at him.&#8221;</span></p>]]></content>

            <description>The answer we seek is not always obvious. As we grow and gain experience we become skilled in sussing out the easy answers. But what about when it&amp;#8217;s hard? When the path is not as well traveled?
Walk on soldier. Persevere and gain the victors spoils for they are well worth the price you must pay.
 &amp;#8230;the willingness to explore the least likely pathways is important for often there can be no other reason for exploring such pathways.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I routinely take the JavaScript primitives for granted. Sure, when I sit there and think about it I can come up with most of them and describe their properties. In more detail and for faster reference in the future, here are the JavaScript Primitives as I know them. More details and fun facts can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects&#34;&gt;Global Objects&lt;/a&gt; page of the mozilla developer documentation site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">String</a> &#8211; The <strong>String</strong> object is a constructor for strings, or a sequence of characters: var test = &#8220;a new string&#8217;. If you want all the characters available to you you could use the constructor: var test = new String(&#8216;a new string&#8217;)

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number">Number</a> &#8211; The <strong>Number</strong> object is a wrapper object allowing one to work with numerical values. A number object is created with the Number() constructor: var test = new Number(11) or var test = 11
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean">Boolean</a> &#8211; The <strong>Boolean</strong> object is a wrapper for a boolean value. var test = true. I haven&#8217;t used it but you can instantiate them with a Constructor function to get the Boolean object and its methods.

      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Object</a> &#8211; The <strong>Object</strong> Constructor creates an object wrapper. I have never used the constructor mentor, I just shortcut it with var test = {}

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array</a> &#8211; The <strong>Array</strong> primitive is a type for arrays, a high level list like object

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN">NAN</a> &#8211; The <b>NAN</b> is a global property ( much less yummy than it&#8217;s distant cousin naan) that is a value representing Not-A-Number

      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined">Undefined</a> &#8211; <strong>undefined</strong> is a global property representing the value undefined

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp">RegExp</a> &#8211; The <strong>RegExp </strong>is an object that can be used for matching patterns in text. I have used both literal and Constructor patterns to instantiate them but prefer the literal method for succinctness.

    <p>
      In the really real world, there are quite a few more &#8216;Primitive&#8217; types in JavaScript. But these are my best friends in daily work when it targeted at the web browser.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll forget it when your app does the same things, in the same way and is as easily customizable as the command line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll forget it when your app does the same things, in the same way and is as easily customizable as the command line.</p>

<p>Pictures and other shiny guy things are optional. But, the exact same functionality must be there. Not almost the same. The same. Oh yeah, an emacs like influence would be a good thing too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh wait. Were you just talking about the git cli? I was talking about everything else that lives there too. Hmm, since I want to stay at my current productivity level, I&#8217;ll remember the terminal for now.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter how. The best thing about my girl is an ability to surprise and delight. All I can try is to give back the same. I know the Maynard genre of music isn&#8217;t at the top of her list but, she enjoys it on my behalf. This is how I ended up at a once in a lifetime concert under a gorgeous moon at the Greek Theater with five bands and three hours of beauteous sonic vibration to enjoy with my best friend. Failure, APC and Puscifer was exciting to begin with. The surprise appearances of Green Jello and Tool were enough to make me giddy like a child, giddy like I was at my first Mushroomhead show back in Cleveland in the early ninties or the rock and roll show I ever went to.</p>

<p>There are moments in time that are precious, unique that will never scale, not even in a digital age. These are the things that ultimately matter the most to me. These are the things I would pass on to an archive to be mined by my grandchildren grandchildren.</p>

&lt;p&gt;We are giving our gold away with the sand and pebbles as we watch the breadcrumbs of our digital lives float down the river of life. We need a sieve and nets that we control. Who cares what they do. Clearly it&amp;#8217;s not illegal and the shareholders seem happy, if fickle. What those folks do does not concern me. What you do does. You have already given it all away, take some back for yourself. For your future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140507-212551.jpg"><img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140507-212551.jpg" alt="20140507-212551.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>

<p>We are giving our gold away with the sand and pebbles as we watch the breadcrumbs of our digital lives float down the river of life. We need a sieve and nets that we control. Who cares what they do. Clearly it&#8217;s not illegal and the shareholders seem happy, if fickle. What those folks do does not concern me. What you do does. You have already given it all away, take some back for yourself. For your future.</p>

<p>What I wonder at is how much of the ephemeral stuff that we take for granted is gold dust? And how many nuggets of truth and love shared between those we care are never preserved? Take a guess, how much space does your digital life online take up? 50GB? 250? They are giving 50GB away if you just sign up with new shiney services that solve all the problems you ever could have in this modern age. (Oddly these shiney things never do everything and that in turn brings in new problems that only newer, shinier niche services can help fix.)</p>

<p><strong>I say, &#8216;keep your gold.&#8217;</strong></p>

<p>Pass it on. It&#8217;s value will compound exponentially down the road. The marketing companies of today don&#8217;t care what happens to it once they have a copy of it. And that&#8217;s the thing; we stop thinking about it there. Sure, dome of us bitch and moan, some of us wonder what the big deal is and some of us just wonder what privacy really means. Once the marketing companies have it, we assume that we have lost it. And this is far from the truth. When we live in a world where everything is just a <strong>copy of a</strong> copy of a copy. We may as well grab one for ourselves.</p>

<p>We can get a copies if we try hard enough. Better companies offer a way to get most if what they collect back from them. And the others, if you are willing to roll your sleeves up and apply some elbow grease to scraping the ones who are not so polite you can get <strong>what&#8217;s important to you.</strong></p>

<p>What we need is an engine that learns to follow us around and keeps us honest with ourselves. Later on, it can help grandchildren with that family history report. This is the other, integral part of the tool. One has to have ways to get personal value out of it. Easily explore and make connections between disparate parts of ones life. And family history reports for thousands of generations.</p>

<p>That historian spider and it web if archives is bundled as part of the service and software updates. You use the tools and get it for your self, keep it safe your self and trust it to the next gen when it&#8217;s time to go.</p>]]></content>

<p>There is one more SO link that has an even better answer than the on provided but I&#8217;ll have to ask my co-worker on monday for it. It&#8217;s better because it answers the &#8216;why&#8217; one is different and this shows how without code examples which always confuse me. Then it sums up with a very simple chart at the bottom. I would look for it right now but my H is is asking why it takes so long to leave a note 🙂 Hacker News is not letting one leave comments right now so I&#8217;m putting this here since I want to expand on it with the link from Tsanko next week.</p>

<p>Ok, she just said &#8220;c&#8217;mon daddy its your turn.&#8217; rolled her eyes and followed up with &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you be here? It&#8217;s your turn.&#8221; Turns out I lost the scrabble game anyway &#8211; 16 triangles to 10 because in this version one gets a triangle for completing preset words on the board in order of letters.</p>

<p>Weird, so Monday when I talked to T, we looked at SO together and he was just as confused as I was. The original answer we both liked for its clarity was gone. While the existing answers are good they are all similar to the &#8220;explanation with an example.&#8221; I much prefer an explanation with here is how fundamentally they differ and why that matters without code. Oh well, the link to the angular mailing list is a welcome addition. It would be nice if the original form of the answer that clicked with my mind had been preserved.</p>

<p>Fair enough H. I&#8217;ll come back to this later</p>

<p>&#8230; As the night nights pass and children sleep, I come back to this though in the morning and roughly I remember the table data points as thus (also stealing a bit from the first link above so I can just come here):</p>

<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

<ul>
<li>Are Singletons</li>
<li>Invocation: returns new instances of its functions (ie invoking myService.myFn() returns a new instance of the function in MyService)</li>
<li>Cannot be configured during angular config phase</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="factories">Factories</h4>

<ul>
<li>Are Singletons</li>
<li>Invocation of myFactory.myFn() returns a value from the Fn referenced</li>
<li>Cannot be configured during angular config phase</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="providers">Providers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Are Singletons</li>
<li>Invocation: returns? &#8216;you are provided with a new ProviderFn().$get() -&gt; constructor fn is instantiated before $get() is called</li>
<li>Can be configured during the modules config phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did find a useful table taken from #4 from the list at the top of this post:</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to program, learn how to break shit first. Some tools (git) make it easy to break. Eventually, once you break enough shit, someone who knows you can break will challenge you. Challenge you to fix something that someone else broke or address a problem that has never been solved but holds them back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Eventually, once you break enough shit, someone who knows you can break will challenge you. Challenge you to fix something that someone else broke or address a problem that has never been solved but holds them back.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to learn to how to program. See, in order to make the previously unmade, it helps to be able to merge bits and pieces from a disparate set of broken things back together again in novel ways. In technology we are very lucky, this is extremely cheap to do, costing mainly ones time and mind.</p>

<p>Now you are ready for style and opinion. See, in order to make it good you have to have an opinion regarding the spectrum existing between good and bad. Now you understand how to rationalize your decisions and collect data. You believe that the data will either support or undermine your rationalization and are honest with yourself because you need accurate data and analysis to justify your style.</p>

<p>Now, when you can do that, you are an engineer whom can create programs. Some folks will think you are a programmer but that is not quite right.</p>

<p>When you can absorb all of the feedback, and learn from the harshest of feedback, you might be ready to level up again. I hope you can level up. It is always exciting when you see someone gain understanding of a larger world.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I was writing some tests for a singleton I need to create and thought this block was cool:
[js]
it(&amp;#8216;should be a Singleton object&amp;#8217;, function () {
var a = siteDNA.getInstance();
var c = siteDNA.getInstance();
expect(a).toBe&amp;copy;;
});

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a variation on the &amp;#8216;play with me&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;what should we do?&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;what game can we play?&amp;#8217; questions that I get asked with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Being a parent has meant that I learned to just let go of what I want to do and go with the flow most of the time. It&#8217;s more fun, leads me on unexpected paths not normal to my routine and sometime, sometimes it takes me back to places I have not visited since I was a child.</p>

<p>There is great power and energy in being child like. There is also a huge amount of entropy and randomness. Recognizing that helps me focus as a parent in guiding her to focus on something while doing childish things.</p>

<p>Today we drew pictures. Me &#8216;guy with hat&#8217; and H &#8216;cube&#8217; &#8211; she told me it&#8217;s her favorite shape right now.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If I found a pot of gold I would be happy for my family. First I would get a puppy. Next I&amp;#8217;d get a phone. Then I&amp;#8217;d get a house.

<p>Some interesting observations here:</p>

<p>First, puppy trumps (smart) phone. Smart emphasize mine because when I tried to describe land lines to Hannah I fell pathetically short. Her response was along the lines of: So, all you could do was talk on them and leave recorded messages? That&#8217;s it?</p>

<p>Second, phone trumps house.</p>

<p>I get the water bottle and mechanical pencil &#8211; those are popular items at school these days. If you have a unique one of theses I suspect it&#8217;s cooler.</p>

            <description>I finished the Doodle Revolution book this morning by Sunni Brown. Overall it taught me that questions are about systems, processes or comparisons (sometimes comparing one system or process to another). These questions lead to meetings with communication, understanding (or lack thereof) and ideas. The addition of those three things lead to answers.</description>

            <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;customization-is-diy&#34;&gt;Customization Is DIY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a custom shelf and didn&amp;#8217;t think any of the usual suspects would have something like I wanted in the price range I wanted. So I&amp;#8217;m going to make my own. Like cooking, the more I do for myself the closer I get to what I want. Perhaps this is because economies of scale must make compromises and I have to make compromises when I dim (do it myself). It&amp;#8217;s just that I can supply the skill and choose which compromises I care about most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Get past the first Protoype as fast as you can. It&amp;#8217;s not going to be perfect but, it should solve your problem and give you a handle on the problem space. This is just the painful birthing process where your idea leaves the mind and enters the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="get-past-the-first-one">Get Past The First One</h3>

<p>Get past the first Protoype as fast as you can. It&#8217;s not going to be perfect but, it should solve your problem and give you a handle on the problem space. This is just the painful birthing process where your idea leaves the mind and enters the world.</p>

<p>When I started, I would often I stop just after this. If it was code that was born,  I would clean up a bit, add some tests to sanity check my assumptions and write a pithy commit linked to the ticket for that story. Some of this is practicality: the real world doesn&#8217;t pay for perfection. But it does pay for functionality at first. When the  perfection is useful, minimal and almost imperceptible it is then that some folks notice. Most never do notice but they will say things like, &#8220;You know I really like that widget but I can&#8217;t put my finger on why.&#8221; Others go about their day without any interruption and never see the widget (until it breaks).</p>

<h3 id="todays-prototype">Todays Prototype</h3>

<p>I seem to be more observant of both space and light in my home and I am less willing to put up with actors in there who offend me with lack of good use. Having a bit of time on my hands I got annoyed by the lack of space in an old pantry in my house and I made a prototype that gives me more space. For $20 in hardware and wood I get a slide out shelf that I can use as a template for some future spaces that are ripe for optimization.</p>

<h4 id="my-constraints-were">My constraints were</h4>

<ol>
<li>No more than a day</li>
<li>No large scale remodeling (use existing structure</li>
<li>It has to cost less than one of the single shelf kits available for order on the internet</li>
<li>I have to be able to reuse the concept in other places around the house</li>
</ol>

<p>I know it looks simple Rather than explain how annoyed I get when I have to reach into the back of that space, I&#8217;ll just show the after prototype images.</p>

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  We start our cycles and learn whats fun and not fun. We learn how to work so that some things are more fun. We try to achieve a dream. We fail. If we are lucky we learn from the failures and keep dreaming. Once day we we find ourselves wishing something for someone else and hoping that they understand how to get there. We try to help then because its fun and we learn that when you teach, you are still a student.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The path we chose to walk follows cycles and everyone should be so lucky to find good people that they can say something like &#8220;Hugs, kisses & I love you too!&#8221;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about why I don&amp;#8217;t want my apps to make me think. I&amp;#8217;m there to do a job and move on. If I have to change this, fix that or connect to the network because the app forgot that it just got the data for this screen a minute ago before I switched apps to check my calendar; then the app is making me do more mental work than I budgeted for the task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking about why I don&#8217;t want my apps to make me think. I&#8217;m there to do a job and move on. If I have to change this, fix that or connect to the network because the app forgot that it just got the data for this screen a minute ago before I switched apps to check my calendar; then the app is making me do more mental work than I budgeted for the task.</p>

<p>Ok, so whats the $64,000 answer to complicated processes that are not simple point and click interfaces? On the web part of the answer seems to be the marriage of data to the DOM. As SPA frameworks and other web app friends become more powerful the elements that are used as interface no longer contain the data, they have the data and functionality built right in. How Lisp like! And, yay JavaScript.</p>

<p>Thinking about a generic problem thats important to me as it keeps coming back to bother J at work is the folks who stare at spreadsheets all day and want to be able to play with forecasting. They sort of know where they are now based on some numbers, they know what they think other variable and dependent numbers will cost down the road. But how can they compile their numbers, chart out the projections and then play with the variables? I searched but didn&#8217;t see anything in Excel that a non programmer could quickly and easily jump into.</p>

<p>So what is the generic solution to the problem? Here is the problem statement:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have several columns of data</li>
<li>Some columns are dependent on other columns</li>
<li>I want to &#8216;see&#8217; the data world as it is today</li>
<li>I want to play with ranges of data to change tomorrows data world and I want to do this from a visual standpoint ( ala the worrydream.com genius ) and with intuitive interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>With modern tools the data can become the interface but this makes it more advanced, more complicated and I don&#8217;t want that. Need to think more on this problem and mock up a prototype to understand the connections.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;There are other things. But tonight the camera in my pocket is worth priceless. When I was a kid and I helped do repair it was taking things apart to see what could be salvaged and putting them back together if there was a way or we could get the right parts to replace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are other things. But tonight the camera in my pocket is worth priceless. When I was a kid and I helped do repair it was taking things apart to see what could be salvaged and putting them back together if there was a way or we could get the right parts to replace.</p>

<p>There was usually a final question related to extra nut, bolt, screw and what were those for? As I got older and graduated to oil changes and gas tank swap outs I really, really, really wish that I could have taken pictures before I started. One thing that I wish I knew back then was to take a snapshot at the crucial ( you know when they are ) phases. It would have been handy if the one thing I had back then was a camera in my pocket and the knowledge to use it. Sort of like version control for DIY stuff at home. Unlike version control in that I can only look back to a moment int time and can&#8217;t make a branch: $ git checkout disposal_repair is what I would call it.</p>

<p>So the pictures are a little bit like a map, more of a guide and a way to provide reference for how things once were. Tonight when I swap this, because it&#8217;s late and I have other things on my mind it&#8217;s pictures all the way baby.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140303-213315.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140303-213315.jpg" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140303-213315.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>It turns out there was no need but I can&#8217;t remember how many times I have said I wish I had taken a picture of that first. You never know. And the upgraded model doesn&#8217;t look 30 years old. Now, I can remember the serial number here when I inevitably lose the happy green save the world with this disposer manual.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140303-224903.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140303-224903.jpg" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140303-224903.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140303-224912.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140303-224912.jpg" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140303-224912.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Now I have a new disposer that doesn&#8217;t leak and that&#8217;s good too.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I had neglected the editor setup on my personal laptop for a while. The only thing that was even close was emacs because I really like org-mode as catch all for things that I want to version control and drag around with me. At work I had started to really like Sublime Text 2 but didn&amp;#8217;t know until after I bought it that it was going away and the license doesn&amp;#8217;t count for ST3. Oh well, I can live with ST2 until it dies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only thing that was even close was emacs because I really like org-mode as catch all for things that I want to version control and drag around with me. At work I had started to really like Sublime Text 2 but didn&#8217;t know until after I bought it that it was going away and the license doesn&#8217;t count for ST3. Oh well, I can live with ST2 until it dies.</p>

<p>As I move on from Zumbox I am moving the customizations from version control onto the personal laptop, sans anything not appropriate. In order to stay current with AngulrJS I restarted an app from the ground up to <a href="http://hippeelee.com/2014/02/onreme/" title="OnReMe">scratch an itch</a> of mine. This will let me keep playing and have something to show if anyone is interested in what I have ben coding lately. It also is the tip of an iceberg that (i feel) is largely ignored by technology today, probably because its not part of the low hanging fruit and people don&#8217;t realize that it is worth paying for. What is weird is that at home I have started to use a dual editor approach for angular: ST2 because its more pleasant to edit in than IntelliJ (Ultimate) or emacs and IntelliJ for debugging because its better than the built in browser dev tools for the way I think.</p>

<p>Batarang is cool but I am still learning how to use it effectively and more often than not, I find myself distracted with exploring the tool rather than solving the issue that took me to the tool in the first place. Also, I prefer to develop with Safari and then fire up a virtual machine for IE testing. It&#8217;s not that Chrome is bad, but it does feel more invasive in an area that I don&#8217;t think it should be interested in unless I opt into.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Zumbox is winding down and I&amp;#8217;m iterating through updated versions of my resume and cover letter. I&amp;#8217;ve been testing the water around TO this week and there are opportunities for sure. Doing the new browser client in AngularJS was very fortuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to take an Angular path to some more JS enlightenment* &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-My-Experience-With-AngularJS-The-Super-heroic-JavaScript-MVW-Framework.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s highs for me were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope, $scope and direct binding to the DOM elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directives as reusable widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory services with the builder pattern for extending an objects functionlity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaYaaq2Miw&#34;&gt;Promises, Promises&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://taoofcode.net/promise-anti-patterns/&#34;&gt;Promise Anti-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still going up (and down 🙂 ) &amp;#8211; every time I drop into the angular source code to trace or debug issues I am treated to a mind expanding experience. And it&amp;#8217;s very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&#8217;m still going up (and down 🙂 ) &#8211; every time I drop into the angular source code to trace or debug issues I am treated to a mind expanding experience. And it&#8217;s very humbling.</p>

<h4 id="i-have-an-itch">I Have An Itch</h4>

<p>When we relocated to Thousand Oaks I went through the process of crafting a general template (isn) cover letter and resume and LinkedIn used to be an ok place to create and share a resume. Not so much any more even though its become the de-facto standard for maintaining a &#8216;professional&#8217; image and professional connections.</p>

<h4 id="i-can-make-back-scratchers">I Can Make Back Scratchers</h4>

<p>Here is I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple editing for various parts</li>
<li>Ability to generate an elegant typeset pdf on demand rather than storing files</li>
<li>Ability to publish and share a version</li>
<li>Ability to track visits for the owner and perhaps add GA since they are free</li>
</ul>

<p>The first pricing model that pops into my head is: free to publish one resume and one cover letter. $10 per year to publish unlimited versions so that each version can be targeted at a specific opportunity and you can track interest in it. Other things that might help it sell are be tools to help people write well by showing them how to refine the existing content and, upgraded &#8216;themes&#8217; and layouts that impose constraints while showing them how to craft and iterate on it.</p>

<p>One other, a pro upgrade (or whatever) I call it would be ability to send links to peer review a version with annotation and comments and for a one off fee &#8211; the ability to connect to a professional resource that can take an initial version and tweak multiple versions for someone who either doesn&#8217;t have the time or writing skill to reduce their message.</p>

<p>This was prompted by the response to the first version of this round I published and showed to some folks on the team. Since we are all in the same boat and we are agile, we seemed to have extended the pairing &amp; code review process for our job searches. I got very good feedback &#8211; the most import point being something that I told myself I needed to fix but hadn&#8217;t gone back for another round of editing yet.</p>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-design-a-tall-javascript-function&#34;&gt;How to design a (tall JavaScript) function:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&#34;&gt;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching the video for &amp;#8220;Design a function to determine if an image is tall.&amp;#8221; and using the tall-starter.rkt in DrRacket. As an exercise I transposed it into JavaScript with the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must get a working prototype as fast as possible (10 minutes or less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it my own ad hoc way since jasmine/karma/protractor are libraries/frameworks and not native to browsers

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="how-to-design-a-tall-javascript-function">How to design a (tall JavaScript) function:</h2>

<p>Original &#8211; <a href="https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule">https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule</a></p>

<p>I was watching the video for &#8220;Design a function to determine if an image is tall.&#8221; and using the tall-starter.rkt in DrRacket. As an exercise I transposed it into JavaScript with the following constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>No libraries</li>
<li>Must get a working prototype as fast as possible (10 minutes or less)</li>
<li>Test it my own ad hoc way since jasmine/karma/protractor are libraries/frameworks and not native to browsers
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="here-is-a-two-sentence-introduction-to-javascript-for-the-non-programmer"><strong>Here is a two sentence introduction to JavaScript for the non-programmer:</strong></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To begin, JavaScript is all about functions and objects.</p>

<p>One way to think about this is to see everything as a function that does stuff and every thing between curly brackets {} as an object or thing that can have stuff done to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see syntax &#8216;var this&#8217; or &#8216;function that&#8217; below. For simple things and exploratory purposes they are ways to tell the JavaScript interpreter what needs to be done and what to do it to. Let&#8217;s get started. I will follow the Design Method defined as part of the htdf module as closely as possible. Open up your web browsers console and type along the statements that follow.</p>

<h5 id="we-need-an-image-this-is-just-an-object-and-we-can-create-it-like-this"><strong>We need an Image. This is just an object and we can create it like this:</strong></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>var Image = function (h,w) {</p>

<p>return {</p>

<p>height: h,</p>

<p>width: w</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>};</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once it is defined I can create new Images and assign them to variables.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>var image = new Image(2, 3);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I can make some images to test with later on. You can also enter the var name into the console and click it to print and inspect its object properties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>var tallImage = new Image(3,2); // { height: 3, width: 2 }</p>

<p>var squareImage = new Image(3,3); // { height: 3, width: 2 }</p>

<p>var shortImage = new Image(2,3); // { height: 2, width: 3 }</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lets-design-our-function-that-checks-if-an-image-is-tall"><strong>Lets design our function that checks if an image is tall.</strong></h5>

<p>We will try to adhere close to the Design Method given in the course. First is the stub, a function called isTall since one cannot use ?&#8217;s in JavaScript function names. All it does is return whatever is given to it. But there are no errors and if you give it one of the objects created above it will give it back to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>//Stub -&gt; should run and return whatever it was given</p>

<p>function isTall (img) {</p>

<p>//@In-&gt;Out: Image -&gt; Boolean</p>

<p>//@Purpose &#8211; produce true if the image is tall</p>

<p>return img;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>isTall(shortImage);    // Returns an object: { height: 2, width: 3 }</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, we move on to the template, which will give you an error when you type it into the console. Thats ok. Even if it didn&#8217;t give an error it wouldn&#8217;t do much but give us some basic structure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>// Template -&gt; should error</p>

<p>function isTall (img) {</p>

<p>//@In-&gt;Out: Image -&gt; Boolean</p>

<p>//@Purpose &#8211; produce true if the image is tall</p>

<p>if (&#8230;) {</p>

<p>return true;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>return false;</p>

<p>}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it does give us an idea for the next step, a prototype that structures our thought around the problem statement. You have a thing with width and height. You need to know when height is less than width, when height is greater than width and when height is the same as width.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>// Prototype One</p>

<p>function isTall (img) {</p>

<p>//@In-&gt;Out: Image -&gt; Boolean</p>

<p>//@Purpose &#8211; produce true if the image is tall</p>

<p>if (img.height &gt; img.width) { // first case</p>

<p>return true;</p>

<p>} else if (img.height &lt; img.width) { // second case</p>

<p>return false;</p>

<p>} else if (img.height === img.width) { // third case</p>

<p>return false;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we take a moment to think about it, we are returning false for all cases except one. That means we can make it more simple and keep the clues to what it does while not making the next person to read the code think, unless they need to. Deduction tells us that the isTall function can be simplified as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>// Prototype Two</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">function isTall (img) {</span></p>

<p>//@In-&gt;Out: Image -&gt; Boolean</p>

<p>//@Purpose &#8211; produce true if the image is tall</p>

<p>if (img.height &gt; img.width) {</p>

<p>return true;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>return false; // Note: the if rule is the only one that satisfies the function statement.</p>

<p>// This means that h &lt; w is short and h === w is false</p>

<p>}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code reviewer voice in my head is muttering about checking to ensure img is really an image and that is has real numbers set for its height and width attributes but, lets trust that it is for this thought experiment and verify it later. Before this code is pushed to production.</p>

<h5 id="proving-that-it-works"><strong>Proving that it works</strong></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>isTall(squareImage)</p>

<p>// false</p>

<p>isTall(shortImage)</p>

<p>// false</p>

<p>isTall(tallImage)</p>

<p>// true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try it out for yourself. Open the console and type in the functions and statements listed above.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I was laying a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. My constraints were:
&amp;#8211; grid like structure
&amp;#8211; on a cork board medium
&amp;#8211; one center of focus
&amp;#8211; even (ish) distribution
&amp;#8211; minimum effort today
Physically doing the layout made me wish I had css3 or iOS auto layout to assist and tweak. It only took four tries ( including previous prototypes ) with some help from my two trusty assistants to get it the way I wanted it.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder, should my app have pretty dead end points so that my user can find them self somewhere or with something that looks cool, pleases the eye with shiny distractions and does nothing function related to the app but entertains and delights and takes their mind down an unintended path for a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wonder, should my app have pretty dead end points so that my user can find them self somewhere or with something that looks cool, pleases the eye with shiny distractions and does nothing function related to the app but entertains and delights and takes their mind down an unintended path for a few minutes?</p>

<p><strong>What could this be?</strong></p>

<p>A button that performs a unique and elegant animation when it&#8217;s pressed. Or maybe it does three randomly similar animations when pressed.</p>

<p>A beautiful picture that reacts to touch, perhaps it warps outward or stretches and blurs the pixels from coordinates that are touched and dragged. Like a barrier to a different universe.</p>

<p>Text that responds to display (stretch &amp; warp) interaction from the user but has specific channels for the content outside of their control. Perhaps one interaction can rearrange the content in novel ways.</p>

<p><strong>Why do this?</strong></p>

<p>Give someone a few short moments to discover <strong>simplicity in a chaotic stream of digital connectedness.</strong> Give them a few moments with easy breathing. When they get bored and the dead end gets redundant they will move on.</p>

<p><strong>Some caveats</strong>.</p>

<p>The dead end has to be entertaining and/or useful to then before you do this.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#8217;t overdue this.</p>

<p>You digital distraction must be polished and well thought out. Even if it&#8217;s only designed for 20 seconds, each second must justify its existence.</p>

<p>Plan meta themes and other connections from the app in advance.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my new Xmas toys was a stylus that has pressure sensitivity and other things available if the app developer implements it. It talks Bluetooth and unfortunately wacom decided to use aaaa batteries to power it. No store in the area carry them and all the shady sellers on amazon ( shady because they send them without being in original packaging even though they picture them as such. About half of the reviewers received dead or expired batteries ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my new Xmas toys was a stylus that has pressure sensitivity and other things available if the app developer implements it.

No store in the area carry them and all the shady sellers on amazon ( shady because they send them without being in original packaging even though they picture them as such. About half of the reviewers received dead or expired batteries ).</p>

<p>What&#8217;s a curious mind to do? With the help of my little assistant and a quick internet search, aaaa batteries can be found in your friendly Duracell nine cold battery. There are six 1.5v aaaa batteries inside and with a little bit of connection management they work just fine. Take a look:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140125-142055.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140125-142055.jpg" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20140125-142055.jpg" /><!--more--></a></p>

<p>Note, not all 9v batteries use the cylinder aaaa format. Some use flat cells stacked vertically on top of each other.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I found myself replying to a conversation thread online and thought it was worth saving.
 Do you plan on having children? Will your grandchildren&amp;#8217;s grandchildren wonder where they came frome and what it was like?
If only I could query the daily activities and conversations of my great grandparents or query thousands of photos and movies for people, places and moments that my have been talked about when I was a child.</description>

<p>If only I could query the daily activities and conversations of my great grandparents or query thousands of photos and movies for people, places and moments that my have been talked about when I was a child. I could understand my family better. Educate my daughter more fully and with better context other than telling her: well part of your family comes from the abruzzi region in Italy and another part comes from Germany, I think. And your mother, I don&#8217;t know much about her grandparents let alone, her great grandparents.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not always about us, or right now, that is important in the scope of life across generations. We don&#8217;t always know which of the ephemeral things in daily life are worth passing on to the next generation. Sometime they ( the next or several generations on down the line ) identify or rediscover our best moments long after we are gone.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about an issue I need to solve for myself I started thing about all things free. Most things online are free, supported with marketing. All it requires is acceptance of Terms &amp;amp; Conditions be they what they may. This causes a problem. Not for me or you but for our grandchildren&amp;#8217;s grandchildren. They will never be able to access the accounts we blindly use with out thinking about the long term view and our relationship with the data we all create. I am company agnostic in this regard: they are all guilty of manipulation human nature for profit. And thats ok, for now. But what about my information a hundred years from now? The corporations won&amp;#8217;t care. I hope and try to parent to create a future generation that will care about the things I have learned and things that shaped and guided me and provided the vibrant color in my life. And if they do, how will the get glimpses of that color? Understand how some things in a hundred years are different to the point of alienation yet others remain as constant as the mountain top that beckons me to walk up and ride down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And if they do, how will the get glimpses of that color? Understand how some things in a hundred years are different to the point of alienation yet others remain as constant as the mountain top that beckons me to walk up and ride down.</p>

<p>So here is the rough dump of my thoughts on this software:</p>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I have lots of data sources, some with PII (Personally Identifying Information): <ul>
        <li>
          Photo software databases
        </li>
        <li>
          Email archives
        </li>
        <li>
          Documents
        </li>
        <li>
          Social Stuff Online: Twitter, google, bitbucket, etc, etc
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal website for brain dump and grandparent kiddo photos
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      I need a simple text box entry point that will return google esque search  results from just that data set, organized by: <ul>
        <li>
          Date(s)
        </li>
        <li>
          Places
        </li>
        <li>
          Photos
        </li>
        <li>
          Videos
        </li>
        <li>
          Text
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      It will require: <ul>
        <li>
          A service to index, scrape and store the assets
        </li>
        <li>
          An interface to interact and modify (meta) data as I wish
        </li>
        <li>
          Security & Account Management
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to mindlessly grant/admin access to ‘layers’ of digital me. This is pretty rough: <ul>
            <li>
              But by default everything is private, even if I let you log in.
            </li>
            <li>
              The interface lets me find and move sets of assets to concentric circles of access with all of ‘Digital Me’ at the center.
            </li>
            <li>
              For some folks, like my wife, daughter (when she is old enough) the can add to me
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  

<p><p>
    Here is the why. My wife and I updated out trust and last year and it got me thinking about the 1.5 TB of data I have collected in the past eleven years. Think about the substantial level of PII and PRI (My own term: Personally Relevant Information) that is useful to the &#8216;Family&#8217; circle is huge there. This raised some questions I want the above software to be able to answer:
  </p></p>

<p><div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How will my daughter answer questions like what was Matts favorite childhood memory? Who were Matt’s grandparents? Where were they from? Most of those answers are in my data … but not accessible
      </li>
      <li>
        How will my daughters grandchildren answer these questions? I can’t easily answer them for myself with out a lot of time and effort to find the right relative to ask. In fact I have asked some things and enjoyed learning the history of my family but forgotten about it. If only my great grandparents could have had the tools I have today &#8211; the insight into forces that shaped my family, me is a compelling idea for me.
      </li>
    </ul></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></div></p>

<p><p>
    Obviously this is a tall order. I used to think that other much smarter people, who made successful technologies and sometimes millions, would think of this and I could pay them to use their tools. Alas, nothing that I know of has come to the forefront. If they can build giant robotic farms that scrape the content of the internet, surely I can build a tool that help and extends introspection for myself.
  </p>

            <description>There are three things I will finish this year:
1) The Story that has need rolling around my head all these years ( mashulg, silent guild &amp;amp; the mellonheads)
2) The Song that exists only in my head and when I play it for Hannah AND the Xmas song for next year with extempore
3) The Images &amp;#8211; the pictures that complement both The Story and The Song need to graduate from doodles into finished files.</description>

<p>1) The Story that has need rolling around my head all these years ( mashulg, silent guild &amp; the mellonheads)</p>

<p>2) The Song that exists only in my head and when I play it for Hannah AND the Xmas song for next year with extempore</p>

<p>3) The Images &#8211; the pictures that complement both The Story and The Song need to graduate from doodles into finished files.</p>

<p>This is not a reinvention year, it is a refinement and enhancement year. I am accountable to deliver three things created with the skills, knowledge and experiences that make me, me.</p>

            <description>I had a minor issue this morning with my work computer. It&amp;#8217;s set up with OSX Mavericks and I use two external monitors. The most anticipated feature I was looking for was the real support for full screen modes on multiple monitors and I have been making heavy use of it. Since I work in a PCI compliant environment I have a five minute time out that locks the system and also requires a password when waking up.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a minor issue this morning with my work computer. It&#8217;s set up with OSX Mavericks and I use two external monitors. The most anticipated feature I was looking for was the real support for full screen modes on multiple monitors and I have been making heavy use of it. Since I work in a PCI compliant environment I have a five minute time out that locks the system and also requires a password when waking up. yesterday and today I had an issue.</p>

<p>My mouse moves by no left clicks are registered on the system. Weird. Ok, yesterday I just did a hard reset. Today I really didn&#8217;t want to do that, to many servers to restart and files open for the AngularJS app I am working on to remember and reopen.</p>

<p>Five minutes searching the internets led me to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>|ruby-1.9.3-p327| matth-mbp in ~/Dev/sites/site-ux</p>

<p>± |master ✗| → killall -KILL SystemUIServer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important thing is killall -KILL SystemUIServer</p>

<p>I am guessing here but SystemUIServer is an object that supports UI Interaction and killing it causes it to bounce. ISK, it fixed my problem and I am glad I can fish for myself rather than doing a full restart every time. Ok, back to the AngularJS issue of how to pass the results of a promise through to a linked directive. Hmmm. Not much on the internets for this one.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the Seventh time I picked out pumpkins with Julie and Hannah. Years gone by and I only blinked my eye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was the Seventh time I picked out pumpkins with Julie and Hannah. Years gone by and I only blinked my eye.</p>

<p>The rock climbing was &#8230; interesting and less about the rocks than I thought it would be. A party preceded by soccer and followed with a visit to the pumpkin patch; it looked like a pretty good day. Never can tell for sure anymore. Even for the experts, the weather is difficult to predict. I just make it up as I go along.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is papa/daughter day at Disney and tonight she was asleep before 7:30. I love it when a plan comes together. Oh yeah, I am happy to report that the bug vacuum was already put to good use protecting both Julie and Hannah from those scary spiders.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m not doing something that pushes my limits when I fall it&#8217;s time to make a change. Likewise, if I&#8217;m not motivated to get up and try again with knowledge gained, its time to make a change.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Procreate more and more. It is steadily replacing Paper by 53 as my go to app to sketch, mock or doodle. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s the weird tone the support staff takes in papers forums (and the sad we&amp;#8217;re just like Apple and we know what&amp;#8217;s best for you attitude; without even knowing why Apple can get away with it and they can&amp;#8217;t) or the Pro part of Procreate: a free downloadable book for the manual, layers and I can import things into the app to draw on top of.</description>

<p>Keywords: search, see, read (Matt) each have different behaviors.</p>

<p>Snippits: pull out different three to seven word phrases, at random* and get them onto the screen as a link to the rest. *not really random but an approximation.</p>

            <description>A post from a notebook that I kept :
&amp;nbsp;
There is no such thing as comfortable.
Success is:
 Self contained Focus Conviction Hardcore with a twist of funk Handstands Trust no one &amp;#8211; Hey, why should I? Trust is earned. Not being a scapegoat. Ever. For yourself, your failures or someone else&amp;#8217;s.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I was thinking back then but I was listening to a lot of Mushroomhead (Carefule here unless you still really like metal, I stopped following them so close around 2004) and Unified Culture at the time.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning Hannah and I did some glitter art. It was inspired by her &amp;#8216;discovery&amp;#8217; of some packets of glitter I found while cleaning the garage last weekend. She &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217; them on my workbench in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each took charge of one paper but helped each other decorate and gave advice on the art direction for the others project. I&amp;#8217;ll leave it up to you to guess who&amp;#8217;s is who&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;First, clone an existing project, don&amp;#8217;t inherit a project from github thats actively developed by someone smarter than you instead of an overseas contractor who was also learning Angular for the first time 😉&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, clone an existing project, don&#8217;t inherit a project from github thats actively developed by someone smarter than you instead of an overseas contractor who was also learning Angular for the first time 😉</p>

<p>Several times different folks on my team have said I should do some demos on the toolchain (git + nom/bower/grunt + Angular). I just don&#8217;t have the time to put anything together right now, and, I am still a novice when it coms to anything more than trying to get things done. So I am writing my thoughts down for the future when time is endless and energy is abundant.</p>

<p>I find that I learn best when I jump right in and collect a list of questions that I can file away for later once I have some experience using the tool(s). I would suggest the same if you are approaching a modern web client for the first time. Related, I was asked on Friday how I would approach things related to version control and Github. Keep in mind that what works for me is closely related to idiosyncrasies and personal preferences.</p>

<p>Here are the GIT work flow guidelines (Think Jack Sparrow) that work for me &#8211; ymmv, especially since most of the code outside of the web client I work on is in subversion and for that, I use git as my svn client:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clone the repo from Github</li>
<li>Keep master up to date by pulling often (at least thrice daily)</li>
<li>Branch for each ZUM Issue and rebase or merge (I don&#8217;t have a feel for one or the other yet) master onto the development often (at least thrice daily)</li>
<li>When a branch with your ZUM issue is addressed or fixed: $ git rebase master then, git checkout master then, git merge your-sum-branch. Finally git push (to the master on github)</li>
<li>I push my local branches to github pretty often but thats just me wanting a backup of the repp&#8217;s, I delete them when I am finished with them.</li>
<li>It is entirely possibleI only know enough of GIT to shoot myself in the foot so you should take all of the above with a grain of salt; internet search and StackOverflow are your friends but be suspicious of even them</li>
</ul>

<p>SInce I was thinking about it, here are some thoughts based on my introduction to Angular: ymmv</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick an issue, story, or area and create an exploratory branch off master</li>
<li>Run it with grunt server, forget setting up/hooking into apache it&#8217;s not needs to learn development</li>
<li>Commit often (I prefer the command line for this over the gui&#8217;s &#8211; its faster. I do use the Atlassian SourcecTree tool for pushing my local branches and fetching as well as getting a visual look at how things fit together)</li>
<li>Commit often when you make a change and its still running. Leave yourself a note.</li>
<li>Muck around with all three (scss, JavaScript and html) levels till you break it and can&#8217;t fix it, then do a $ git reset &#8211;hard (This wipes out all uncommitted changes and restores you back to you last hopefully recent and working commit)</li>
<li>Since we are all Angular beginners (at my company we only ramped up Angular development in May and I didn&#8217;t jump in over my head until late June), if you fix something or make a change you think should go into master, <del>grab me and I can help</del> ask someone to help you merge it into master or do a pull request <del>and I</del> that someone more knowledgeable can review it/m,edge it asynchronously</li>
<li>If you are doing anything css related push the dist/ filles to an apache server (I have a simple grunt_and_deploy script that does this for me) and test in IE9/10 first (if you have to support them)</li>
<li>$ grunt is your friend, even when it yells at you. It will jslint the code base for us. (I try not to commit to master unless grunt is happy but it&#8217;s not happy right now and there are some other things to attend to at the moment</li>
<li>$ grunt server is also your (development) friend along with a decent JS/CSS/HTML editor that lets you debug in the browser. I find myself jumping back and forth between Chromes built in tools and the tools for my editor</li>
<li>It is entirely possible that I only know enough JavaScript + Angular to shoot myself in the foot so you should take the above with a grain of salt; internet search and StackOverflow are your friends but be suspicious of even them</li>

            <pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2013 03:56:04 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2013-09-06-keekee-gets-frisky/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130905-205721.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130905-205721.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20130905-205721.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KeeKee is our cat. Sometimes he gets frisky and starts playing rough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130905-205721.jpg"><img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130905-205721.jpg" alt="20130905-205721.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>

<p>KeeKee is our cat. Sometimes he gets frisky and starts playing rough.</p>

<p>His behavior manifests in two ways, either he will lie on his back and wait for you to attack him with a hand or a foot, or he will pounce on a leg from behind some cover. To a certain extent I&#8217;ll let him play rough, egg him on a bit and challenge him because I have two hands and opposable thumbs. Then, I tell him that it&#8217;s game over and he acts like a cool cat as he walk away.</p>

<p>When Hannah was little I had to coach her in an appropriate way to handle the frisky behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> I would say, &#8216;When he gets to rough it&#8217;s ok to use the palm side of your fingers to pop him on the nose and then push him away.&#8217; Hannah would reply, &#8216;But only until he goes away?&#8217; And I would respond,&#8217;Yep, you have to learn to protect yourself from him.&#8217;</p>

<p><strong>Not Acceptable:</strong>I would say, &#8216;When he gets rough it&#8217;s ok to protect yourself.&#8217; Hannah would reply, &#8216;If I kick him really hard it will make him stop.&#8217; And I would respond (to the 2.5-3 year old Hannah) &#8216;No, it&#8217;s not ok to kick him, just pop him on the nose and push him away. You need to learn to protect yourself from him.&#8217;</p>

<p>For the most part it&#8217;s really him that needs protection from her, she carries him all around the house, makes him stay in her room and scold him when he escapes and puts him under blankets in her forts. However, he does get frisky and now she knows how to protect herself from him.</p>

<p>Anyway, Mr KeeKee has all his claws, goes outside and is a murderous little hunter. That&#8217;s why he has a bell on when he goes outside. To protect the birds. Before we put the bell on he would bring us avian and reptile presents. We don&#8217;t get any birds when he wears it and fewer lizards get brought inside. I&#8217;m ok with that, when he gets out without the collar the birds really don&#8217;t have a chance and we bring him in at night so he can be safe from the coyotes. I think he remembers the coyote that tried to eat him in Colorado so unless he is hanging out with his cat buddy from somewhere in the neighborhood he comes when you call him.</p>

<p>Here are some things he has taught me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keeping your claws and teeth sharp is useless unless you have an outlet to that lets you use them</li>
<li>Cat naps are the real deal</li>
<li>Find a quiet out of the way space and watch everything</li>
<li>We learn to protect ourselves appropriately, even from trusted pets</li>
</ol>

<p>He is only a medium sized cat at around 15lbs. In my mind it begs the question, &#8216;Why would anyone ever think they could handle anything bigger and wild?&#8217; I get the coolness factor of cats that are bigger, when they play they they are still playing with razor sharp knives. Anything bigger then him could do some serious damage to a person while it&#8217;s just playing. It&#8217;s just common sense that when said &#8216;pet&#8217; decides its time to hunt it&#8217;s not going to have to go far to find you.</p>]]></content>

            <title>Sonic Cycles</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything is tied to a cycle, a rhythm and the beat of someones drum. Things pulse and we are drawn to them in unison. Be it music, be it it code (hardware &amp;amp; software) be it a summer festival in the sun. We are all drawn to the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, music is the light and  I&amp;#8217;m just a fan of anything good. I grew up in northeastern Ohio with the heavy metal hard rock that was really, really fun in the nineties along the Cuyahoga River. Then, Lake Erie and the flats were a great place to experience music and pure Rock &amp;amp; Roll. And then Lallapalooza &amp;#8217;91 came into town and blew my mind. It expand all of the possibilities to the next level that led me to where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I grew up in northeastern Ohio with the heavy metal hard rock that was really, really fun in the nineties along the Cuyahoga River. Then, Lake Erie and the flats were a great place to experience music and pure Rock &amp; Roll. And then Lallapalooza &#8217;91 came into town and blew my mind. It expand all of the possibilities to the next level that led me to where I am today.</p>

<p>Looking back, there was a rich history of pop , rock, metal, funk and techno to dive into. Then, when the ecosystem changed an a digitally forced evolution changed everything I had the foundation to continue to keep on experiencing sonic nirvana. It&#8217;s been fun. It&#8217;s made me realize that good music will always rise above genres, charts and top 40 analysts. People will always search for and find  something that connects &#8211; to a place, to a time to a group of like minded individuals.</p>

<p>Given that I believe that  we all want to connect to a common thread &#8211; there is a sonic revolution coming. I hear it it the #nin2013 tour online and I anticipate it in the optimistically hopeful next Tool album that will make great noise and dramatic visual candy.</p>

<p>Right now it feels very late 70&#8217;s, very funky and groovy. Cool. I like it. But, I can&#8217;t wait for that Nirvana on Saturday Night Live moment when I understand that things have changed and Hard Rock, same as the old Rock &#8211; is back in town.</p>

<p>To me, all music is rock-n-roll. If its got a good beat and a catchy lyric &#8211; i&#8217;ll buy. But, I truly, I deeply, love whah whah driven, phase shifted screaming raw vocals with a syncopated drum line that epitomizes rock-and-roll as I have experienced it. It&#8217;s coming back around again. I hear it and it won&#8217;t be on your radio.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I sent this into &lt;a href=&#34;https://uncommon.cc&#34;&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;. They ask nice questions. Here is my answer to this one: **Is there something you&amp;#8217;ve lost that you&amp;#8217;ve never forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was three, maybe four years old in northeastern Ohio on an autumn afternoon. My parents made us rake up the leaves one afternoon. It was one of those magical afternoons. Where the sunlight filters down through the mature forest and motes of dust hang between oaks, silver maples and beech trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my shoes off, like I still do. There is nothing like the feeling of green grass and crunchy leaves underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sent this into <a href="https://uncommon.cc">uncommon</a>. They ask nice questions. Here is my answer to this one: **Is there something you&#8217;ve lost that you&#8217;ve never forgotten?</p>

<p>**</p>

<p>I was three, maybe four years old in northeastern Ohio on an autumn afternoon. My parents made us rake up the leaves one afternoon. It was one of those magical afternoons. Where the sunlight filters down through the mature forest and motes of dust hang between oaks, silver maples and beech trees.</p>

<p>I took my shoes off, like I still do. There is nothing like the feeling of green grass and crunchy leaves underfoot.</p>

<p>These shoes were the first sneakers I remember picking out for myself. They were blue with white stripes and had a rubber sole that wrapped up and over the toes. On the bottom of the sole, the tread had a zig zag pattern that made you faster just by looking at it. Because these shoes were special I put them to the side before I tackled one of my siblings into the mountainous pile of red, orange and yellow leaves we had raked together. Unfortunately the pile of leaves scattered the more we jumped and wrestled on top of it. And then we had to rake them up again. So we raked them into the woods by the edge of the ravine.</p>

<p>When mom called, I went to grab my shoes. I could only find one. Knowing the other was in the pile of leaves &#8211; I jumped back in and began casting about trying to find it. I felt it and grabbed on with my left hand. Then my sister jumped on me and we went tumbling through the pile of leaves into the woods and part way down the hill on top of the ravine. The shoe was gone. Now, instead of a pile of leaves on top of green grass, there was a thin, pre-winter blanket of leaves above my knees covering the forest floor. It was hiding my shoe.</p>

<p>I went back to that spot often; I looked for that shoe until it snowed that year. I kept the mate until spring cleaning and when I cleaned out my closet, I let it go and moved on.</p>

<p>I still think about the shoe that went missing. But I never start by thinking about it. Often, I remember the sunshine filtering through the mid-western forest trees. I remember an enormous pile of leaves. I remember laughing with my siblings on a cool fall day that ended with a lost shoe.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&#34;&gt;JIRA&lt;/a&gt; this morning and it tried to think for me. A few months ago we switched to JIRA issue tracking at work. ANd it is miles ahead of the disjointed system we were using before. Still, it tried to think for me to make things easier I assume. It didn&amp;#8217;t get it right and ended up leading me down a path that caused me to re-do about five minutes of working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> this morning and it tried to think for me. A few months ago we switched to JIRA issue tracking at work. ANd it is miles ahead of the disjointed system we were using before. Still, it tried to think for me to make things easier I assume. It didn&#8217;t get it right and ended up leading me down a path that caused me to re-do about five minutes of working.</p>

<p>On my team we use four kinds of tasks: Sub-tasks (to break a story down into coding chunks), Story Test (To independently test the feature), Code Review (To share knowledge and learn from peers) and Acceptance (For the Product Team to review and accept or reject based on their Acceptance Criteria).</p>

<p>So I got in early and I started by making a sub task for a story I am fleshing ou. I needed to make about seven more sub-tasks. I thought I was making sub tasks. Turns out the last one I made before this was of type Acceptance. For a different iOS story. Yesterday. All the sub-tasks I made were Acceptance. No big deal, just go back in and update. Done and move on. Except that this in not the first time it has happened.</p>

<p>Maybe there should be an explicit rule: Do not try to think or remember for me unless you can do it exactly the way I would. Otherwise, keep it simple and find a way to gently remind me that the last thing I did (a minute, an hour, a day a week ago &#8230;) was valueX and give me an easy way to adjust as I see fit.</p>

<p>I think this because, in the stream of consciousness that is daily life, I often forget what I did an hour ago or yesterday morning. I tell my Hannah that Papa&#8217;s are forgetful. Often. She tells me to set a reminder -&#8220;Siri, remind me to play Badland with Hannah Saturday AM&#8221;. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reminders are not thoughts for me</span>. I have an explicit action I want to do in the future. There is no sense wasting thought on it now when my phone is very well suited to beep at me when its time. Thinking for me is a fuzzy, unintuitave guessing game at best. If its done poorly and I am not 100% on top of the system I am using, it will cost me more in time than it will save me in the long run.</p>

<p>One thing I am learning is that time is a precious, limited commodity. Perceived time, what matters most to me, is also getting faster as I get older. <a href="http://www.andersoninstitute.com/perception-of-time.html">Your perception of time between 0-1 years old is longer than your perception of time from 1-100 years old</a>.  When an application steals five minutes from me, well I have a visceral reaction to it. Thats likely why I get annoyed when I have to call outdated companies that still put me on hold inserted of taking my number, putting it in a queue and calling me back when ready.</p>

<p>I am all for automatically letting my app think for me. Especially the mundane last settings used low hanging fruit &#8211; my app should not think for me unless it can do it reliably, the way I do it (fragile emotional state and all that included) or not at all.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything evolves. Not quite the same as the Darwinian definition of the word but its a close metaphor. But, in the small, learning and adapting behavior to take advantage of knowledge sense of the word. That&amp;#8217;s why animals, people included, migrate. Birds go where it&amp;#8217;s warmer and the food is easy. People migrate around various web properties because they find value for their time there. Then a new shiny service starts up and they migrate again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It has been my goal to migrate my site away from shared hosting for a while now. At any given time I have 10+ vhosts on my various development computers. So in real life it is frustrating to need to escape the shared hosting handcuffs when I want to do something outside of a web, one click install thingy. Also, not being able to apt-get blah so I can try something out is annoying.</p>

<p>Justifying the cost to my CFO, however, was never viable at the costs when I priced my options. Enter the new cool kid on the block: DigitalOcean. For $5 a month they give me everything I need to run my site in my own virtual server. It&#8217;s even less than the old shared hosting account I migrated away from. Yes, this is the first post to my new setup.</p>

<p>Things left to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirm that the DNS has propagated</li>
<li>Cancel Bluehost account</li>
<li>Migrate and modify the site&#8217;s back up script to the new host</li>
<li>Go for a ride</li>
</ul>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is about tools. Not the scary old dude at the Katie Perry concert by himself or the harmoniously awesome band. My tools. The same ones you might use if you decide to make something similar things that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, about a year ago I started down a new path. I thought it was the same old path I had ridden a thousand times before. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t. It was different. The opportunity was different and I knew that by the time the interview ended and they had had good, thoughtful answers for most of my questions. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>See, about a year ago I started down a new path. I thought it was the same old path I had ridden a thousand times before. But it wasn&#8217;t. It was different. The opportunity was different and I knew that by the time the interview ended and they had had good, thoughtful answers for most of my questions. </p>

<p>And then, they didn&#8217;t even want me to do traditional web development. Well they did but the iOS stuff was more important, they were agile and I was the one who had drunk the most from Apple&#8217;s cool aid jar. Never mind you that I only had half way completed the Stanford iOS series and gotten busy with the move back to the west coast. Never mind that I really didn&#8217;t understand what a delegate pattern was or how to implement it in Objective-C or any language. They were agile. I was interested; and I was smart enough from wondering what was wrong with the folks I was trying to learn from while stumbling around various Boulder *start-up&#8217;s (1) who claimed to be agilely implementing the next great OOP architected LAMP CRUD web app with an iframed UIWebView container for the website as a native version for iOS.</p>

<p>I digress, this is about tools. But the stumbling and internal questioning I did was integral in figuring out just how important your tools are. See, I already knew about tools in the real world. <a href="http://hippeelee.com/blog/2012/02/an-easy-toolchain/" title="An Easy Toolchain">Dad taught me that.</a>So, when I got the opportunity to dive into Xcode and build compiled software I spent some time learning how to debug with gdb first and the lldb when they switch it over. Break points, stack traces and Instruments. Oh my! What an eye opener after working in php log dumps for so long. Then I also had to get into the CI side of things for some stuff and now for the api our Angular app runs on and PHPStorm was the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>So I was using these new (to me) tools and getting more productive. Now I am incorporating SublimeText into the flow as a pseudo replacement for emacs across all platforms. I can version control the config file, drop it onto my Ubuntu dev server, windows VM and MBP development laptop and have the same editor with a quick git pull from my bitbucket. The whole point of this post is to highlight the power of tools and for the first time in a long time not only am I using others but I am creating my own.</p>

<p>SInce moving back to front end implementation and the Angular app I have discovered the tool chain associated with efficiently writing code and seeing the results. It&#8217;s not instantaneous but it&#8217;s a lot faster than when I started my second career and this whole software thing. So, in solving my issue (how to use grunt to develop for IE I wrote a quick script to compile and deploy the app to my dev server. I call it, appropriately grunt_and_deploy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1) IMO 90% of Boulder start-ups are really lifestyle businesses in disguise.</p>]]></content>

<p>Watching the Apple dev videos and playing with the iOS7 beta has given me ideas for transitions between content.</p>

<p>A swipe to action includes a transition that splits the current view and moves the halves out of viewport for destruction. Even if its a refresh could be new. The video playing in my mind is that of the person holding a picture of a person holding a picture on endless gifified loop.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was curious about the new nexus 7 that is all the rage and in the news. Specifically how would a comparable nexus 7 compare to the iPad mini. I want to know this because I have really come to enjoy the mid range form factor the 7 inch screen brings to mobile computing with a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was curious about the new nexus 7 that is all the rage and in the news. Specifically how would a comparable nexus 7 compare to the iPad mini. I want to know this because I have really come to enjoy the mid range form factor the 7 inch screen brings to mobile computing with a tablet.</p>

<p>So search for the device and go to googles store. Scan the marketing fluff for option to buy. I&#8217;m really only interested in a comparable device. Wait! Only 32GB max memory? Wifi only? So no 3G and by proxy no gps which means I can&#8217;t even compare the two. They are apples and oranges, different use cases for different types of customers.</p>

<p>Oh well, it took a few years but the android so eventually go good enough for Apple to steal back the good ideas for the upcoming iOS 7 release. Perhaps the hardware will get there too because the coolest thing about my mini is using it in a waterproof case to take underwater pictures and leave waypoints with the Gaia mapping app (also available on Android which is why I wanted to compare the two devices). What, who cares? I hear you. This is why I care. I like beating able to put media for myself, my wife and my daughter in one device and have enough room left for taking movies, editing the video and pictures into content for showing the grand parental units. I also love being able to download map sets (open street maps, bike maps and Topo maps galore) ahead of time and still use them withou needing the data plan. Hell, half of the places I go still won&#8217;t work well with 3G/4g tech. With the built in GPS sensor it doesn&#8217;t matter. Pictures are still geo tagged, map sets still work.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s not fair for me to comment on the nexus 7 because it&#8217;s apple and the iPad mini is an orange. I love shiny things new but am settling in in the features that work for me and the nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t have them yet.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The next user interface will combine motion with action. Most of the &amp;#8216;action&amp;#8217; will be spoken in the way an executive gives orders to the minions. Copy this, save that and put the other thing over there, oh yeah, when I finish this, remind me to do the other thing before I get distracted by shinty Internet things. All desired actions will  be spoken aloud in conversation. You know people like me whom in the middle of a problem talk it through. Yeah, these additions to ourinterface will be great for us. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The next user interface will combine motion with action. Most of the &#8216;action&#8217; will be spoken in the way an executive gives orders to the minions. Copy this, save that and put the other thing over there, oh yeah, when I finish this, remind me to do the other thing before I get distracted by shinty Internet things. All desired actions will  be spoken aloud in conversation. You know people like me whom in the middle of a problem talk it through. Yeah, these additions to ourinterface will be great for us. 🙂</p>

<p>The motion will be intricate: it will help you enhance the details and put the polish on your finished product. Instead of tap, tap, tapping your way to consumption of Internet media as we do with &#8216;touch&#8217; actions. You will caress the details into brilliant messages with the style and elegance used by master craftsman for hundreds of years to produce real things in the world.</p>

<p>The future is me, telling my computer to set up a new blog post; with my voice while I am running and then dictating the words while I continue to jog around the park I will create when I am most creative, when the creative stream washes ashore. When I get home I will tell the computer to read my draft. While the draft is read back I will stop it, edit it and massage the message to be clear: &#8216;delete the last sentence&#8217;, &#8216;replace it with this one&#8217; and then change all phrases with &#8216;for realz&#8217; to &#8216;go sho.&#8217;</p>

<p>We all multi task ( albeit poorly since even with advanced chips there is no way to do two things at once and your computer is just better at hiding it from you than your employees are ). While I am in the listen, edit and revise mode of creating content I am also using the Leap Motion inspired interface to dig through my photo library to find the best images to enhance my creation.</p>

<p>Hmmm is there a modern repl (read eval print loop) concept for the new visual interfaces? cesl? Create, edit, show &amp; loop &#8211; could make for great power with a direct andive feedbsck mechanism integrated to it. Is there something wrong with that analogy all together?</p>

<p>When it&#8217;s ready I just tell the computer it&#8217;s ready and the computer knows to push it to my longer form writing channel. In the future, we will tell our computers what to do while we are tapping, swiping, and grabbing our content and creations with both hands in mid air between our minds and our monitors.</p>]]></content>

<p>I have been looking for an editor that was robust enough to handle a wide range of languages. On any given day I can go from HTML/CSS to JavaScript to PHP. Usually i&#8217;ll stop on the command line for some Bashing. I am looking for something close to emacs in that it can be extended and customized. While there is nothing like emacs (for me) Sublime Text 2 seems to fit the bill. So this week I ponied up and bought a personal license. That taken care of i set to work searching the internets for customization tips.</p>

<p>What I like about it is that like emacs you can customeize in bite size hunks: one thing at a time. This will build up a robust config file I can put into my bitbucket and push and pull my changes from wither my Ubuntu dev server or the MBP I use for dev also.</p>]]></content>

<p>Toasting tips:</p>

<p>Write out the toast and practice practice practice, out loud. Not a speech so keep it short enough to memorize. Practice it twice on the day of the speech. Keep some notes in your pocket. Stick to a simple format: talk a bit about who is being toasted and your shared history with them. Follow up and close with a sincere wish on their behalf.</p>

            <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe she is moving on from kindergarten. It seems like the long days of home work and coordinating drop offs, pickups and school events coalesce into a brief moment that passes by while I was blinking.
Now she can read, to me. Now she can do math, well adding and subtracting. Now she has bff&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; although they are quite dynamic. Now she can dress herself for uniform days or free dress days and she knows better than info what the rules are.</description>

<p>Now she can read, to me. Now she can do math, well adding and subtracting. Now she has bff&#8217;s &#8211; although they are quite dynamic. Now she can dress herself for uniform days or free dress days and she knows better than info what the rules are. Now she can use a computer but she is better with the iPad &#8211; even though she got a G on her report card.</p>

<p>Now she is a first grader. In other, unrelated events, input the dev version of iOS 7 on my dev device so I could finish my game by the end of this year. While the work focus switches back to web and Angular in particular, I don&#8217;t want to fall behind where Xcode is going so this motivates me to set up all the new goodies at home.</p>

            <description>I sometimes use my site as a file transfer mechanism. It&amp;#8217;s easier or email services do silly things and make it hard to transfer files in an easy way. I don&amp;#8217;t use dropbox and googles drive is more cumbersome than $scp filename.zip to my hose. With my ssh keys in place its trivial to put the file where I need it to go.
I schedule an automated backup script to backup my site and its databases every month.</description>

It&#8217;s easier or email services do silly things and make it hard to transfer files in an easy way. I don&#8217;t use dropbox and googles drive is more cumbersome than $scp filename.zip to my hose. With my ssh keys in place its trivial to put the file where I need it to go.</p>

<p>I schedule an automated backup script to backup my site and its databases every month. It also does some clean up for me. Yesterday when I reviewed its report I noticed that this months backup was 4x larger than the month before. Weird I thought but wondered if I had put the video up there instead of up to youtube. Then I realized a couple of months ago I had put a large archive or photos on there to share with some folks. I had never deleted it. SInce I was already there poking around it was trial to rm the-large-file.zp.</p>

<p>I love, love, love the command line. It just makes it so easy to do things that should be simple to do. Now that I know enough to use muscle memory and have pre-paid the thought that goes into the learning how to do basic things, I don&#8217;t have to think about it. I just write the text that will do what I want.</p>

<p>I hope I can teach that to Hannah &#8211; the power is learning to use tools is cumulative and exponential &#8211; just like starting to save for retirement when you are in your early twenties instead of later on! Do a little bit now, chip away at it everyday and reap huge benefits in the coming years.</p>

<p>Happy Friday.</p>

            <description>A reoccurring theme in any business is the marketing and &amp;#8216;systematic&amp;#8217; communication that needs to take place between a company and a customer. I have been working on something like this during the past sprint. Except that even with a complex system it is still manual to update the content, ie the message. Further complicating this is that as undesirable (IMO) as email is, it is still a requirement for customer outreach.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A reoccurring theme in any business is the marketing and &#8216;systematic&#8217; communication that needs to take place between a company and a customer. I have been working on something like this during the past sprint. Except that even with a complex system it is still manual to update the content, ie the message. Further complicating this is that as undesirable (IMO) as email is, it is still a requirement for customer outreach.</p>

<p>What to do, the thoughts that danced around my dreams and woke me this morning were fuzzy but they generally followed this pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with two rock solid templates, one for email and one for web</li>
<li>Separate container templates gives you cross platform consistency when it is email delivery and latest greatest flat responsive design capability for web delivery</li>
<li>Seperate content from the container (also called presentation to web geeks)</li>
<li>Use automation (programming) to generate the message on demand; this can be stand alone tool or integrated into the system itself</li>
</ul>

<p>What this allows is the separation of management into two layers. The web person only needs to worry about how the container will render in each medium. The marketing person only needs to worry about what the message says. Together they can maintain and build a robust channel that reaches customers at desired points in time.</p>

<p>Here is my brain dump, graphically:</p>

            <description>I started putting thought online and figured that was it. It would be easy to make it look good and easy to write well. Double ha on both of those. The writing is slightly easier (when I do it regularly) if I write, rewrite and then rewrite it two more times. It helps to regularly read E.B White and Strunk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;The Elements of Style.&amp;#8217;
The look and feel of the site is harder, sure there are free and paid themes for WordPress but tweaking them only gets you so far.</description>

<p>The look and feel of the site is harder, sure there are free and paid themes for WordPress but tweaking them only gets you so far. Once you want to really reflect individual personality you end up really designing your own styles on top of a good start.</p>

<p>Today, I am putting a brand? logo? That has been rolling around inside for a while. I have tied several versions and this is just the latest but it is closer to what I see inside than anything else that has come out so far.</p>

            <description>These days I spend more time in Xcode with Objective-C than the web application part of my world. However the API needs to talk to the iOS app so I jump back into that world intermittently. I used to think JavaScript was my strongest language and that PHP was second.
No more! Today i modified the Objective-C code that interfaces to the API in a fraction of the time it took me to figure out how to change the API for this particular issue.</description>

            <description>They say that its the little things that kill. The straw that breaks the camels back.
Conversely it is the little things the make large efforts worthwhile. A hand on your shoulder and a word of encouragement; a well timed challenge to make it keep going, The power we have in our every day lives to influence begins and depends on the little things we do. I see this as a father.</description>

<p>Conversely it is the little things the make large efforts worthwhile. A hand on your shoulder and a word of encouragement; a well timed challenge to make it keep going, The power we have in our every day lives to influence begins and depends on the little things we do. I see this as a father. It can be an exercise in humility (Of course I am always wrong and the sky is not blue) and a marathon of patience (It is time to get dressed, we need to leave for school; it is time to get dressed, we need to leave for school; it is time to get dressed, we need to leave for school &#8230; and on and on every day 🙂 )</p>

<p>So when I uncover something like the scan below I hold it close and enjoy the moments we have to talk about it and smile. I remind myself that just because I am the teacher I still have much to learn and re-learn and that I have a choice every day to help break someones back or find an opportunity to place a hand on someones shoulder and lift them up. It is the little things that help that are worth so much.</p>

            <description>Hannah had lots of fun at the Pincrest jump rope for the heart. They she has been using mine because the first one we got her didn&amp;#8217;t work as good as mine.
Yesterday we picked her out a new one and today she got a second one from school. Attached to it was this plane. She did the assembly all by herself on the ride home from school. Last Sunday I got to show her how the Volvo brakes come apart and go back together.</description>

<p>I tried to explain to her why they were called Allen wrenches and had to admit that I really didn&#8217;t know. Today she showed me how much she absorbs even when I&#8217;m not paying attention.</p>

            <description>I worked on a project with Hannah this week. We had to design and implement a Leprechaun trap that she could assemble at school. We were constrained to using materials found at home and that could be assembled at school.
We had two designs. The first, using an empty tissue box, was inspired by the raccoon traps in the book &amp;#8216;Where the Red Fern Grows.&amp;#8217; The trapping idea was that we would put something shiny in it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I worked on a project with Hannah this week. We had to design and implement a Leprechaun trap that she could assemble at school. We were constrained to using materials found at home and that could be assembled at school.</p>

<p>We had two designs. The first, using an empty tissue box, was inspired by the raccoon traps in the book &#8216;Where the Red Fern Grows.&#8217; The trapping idea was that we would put something shiny in it. This would attract the little fairy creature. When he tried to steal our treasure, his fist would be too big to pull out of the box and he would be trapped until Hannah let him out in exchange for all of his gold and a trip to the end of the rainbow.</p>

<p>I was informed that Leprechaun&#8217;s are smarter than raccoons and that this probably would not work. I had to cme up with a plan be yesterday morning because *all* the other kids already had their materials at school. So using a box, a small block of wood, some string and shiny brass angle bracket we came up with this design:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130315-084958.jpg"><img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130315-084958.jpg" alt="20130315-084958.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>

<p>This design uses a rather cool looking designer box. It is about the size of a shoe box and has a pink lid. there are fish designs on the outside and a label, frontside. The idea here is to turn the box upside down and prop one side of the box above the lid with a block of wood. There is a hole drilled in the wood so we can tie a string from it to a shiny brass angle bracket that (the Leprechaun will think it is gold) and put the bracket onto the lid. When the little fairy man would climbs in the trap to steal our shiny gold, Bam! The trap is triggered when he grabs the bait and the wood block falls out from under the box. The box will fall neatly onto the lid; sealing his fate and ensuring our retirement will be comfortable and well funded with rainbow gold. My favorite kind.</p>

<p>Hannah assures me that the box is to heavy for him to lift. Once he springs the trap, voila, he will give us all his gold and a trip on the rainbow. It&#8217;s Hannah&#8217;s job to assemble the trap. I&#8217;ll get a picture of it this afternoon and can post the real thing.</p>

<p>And here it is, in the wild:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130330-221353.jpg"><img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130330-221353.jpg" alt="20130330-221353.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130330-221416.jpg"><img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130330-221416.jpg" alt="20130330-221416.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>

<p>The trap worked the first night. It effectiveness wore off in the following week.</p>

            <description>After six months of iOS, I went back to the web. Liked the client side, but could have done without the php. Colds and coughs tore through school and us by extension. Ah, it makes us stronger, like a good workout.
When we moved I found a bunch of journal entries I made over the years. It&amp;#8217;s interesting. There is a lot of silly things. Although I&amp;#8217;m putting this online in 2012, I&amp;#8217;m putting the original publish date when it was written.</description>

            <description>Teaching Hannah how to run her iPod touch was easy, I just had to play with the settings and shines noises. Then when I take a picture of it, she tells me to wait. And she asks me how to resign the keyboard from the screen.
So when she steps on her first digital stones and wants to move them around, i can only smile and agree.</description>

            <description>Letting go is the hardest parental job to do. Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &amp;#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&amp;#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me.</description>

<p>Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me. It worked, she figured out how to turn and stop and all the things I was scared of, well they are still there. She tells me she wants to go faster now.</p>

<p>Same thing yesterday at the park. I know that there will be some bonks and bangs learning to ride without training wheels. THe hardest thing to do isn&#8217;t something she can do for herself. I have to let go and trust that she will find a way to keep her balance as long as she keeps moving forward.</p>

            <description>Tried to set up a Hangout for family in different states. For regular users of google plus not an issue. For users who logged in a while ago and set everything up just after the service went public not so much. Here is what I noticed on Christmas AM while trying to help them and watch my daughter open her gifts from Santa.
 Plugins are horrible for ux &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s why we just had them revert to FaceTime, it never asks you to install anything.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tried to set up a Hangout for family in different states. For regular users of google plus not an issue. For users who logged in a while ago and set everything up just after the service went public not so much. Here is what I noticed on Christmas AM while trying to help them and watch my daughter open her gifts from Santa.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plugins are horrible for ux &#8211; that&#8217;s why we just had them revert to FaceTime, it never asks you to install anything.</li>
<li>Being overly helpful distracts the user from what they want to do &#8211; google noticed the user had not logged in in a while. Great nice for them. No they don&#8217;t want to add circles. No they are not interested in events, no they don&#8217;t want to do anything else except go to the hangout they have been told is easy to get to if they could just get to the stream where the link is. More than five minutes later they can now install the plug in, again. Awesome, not.</li>
<li>While giving up freedoms to join a closed system/walled garden has drawbacks, it also has upsides: when they can use FaceTime there is no tech support needed from me, I just hope Apple extends FaceTime for group chats. And the easy to use video chat just works, as they expect without any extra clicks, distracting questions that help them get more out of the service or tangent issues that have to be solved before they get to e video chat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line, today I wish FaceTime had group chat, it would have been easy for <strong>all</strong> the people I wanted to participate in my daughters Xmas morning. It would not have required any trouble shooting from my end.</p>

<p>Hangouts failed today because the interface got in the way. It forced the users to do other things besides video chat &#8211; troubleshooting and mindshare to figure out how to get to the video chat. Maybe that&#8217;s a difference in the corporate goals for the two services, one company needs to turn the users into advertising dollars and the other needs to turn the users dollars into revenue.</p>

<p>Either way, I found myself wishing the two services could be combined so I could focus on Christmas morning instead of technology in order to share Christmas online. I would pay for that if it did not require those who were invited to also have to pay.</p>

            <description>Lets get ready for the new year and start with this blog. We start by cleaning out all the old cobwebs in the corners and strip the structure down to its framework. Just the bare skeleton for now. Thats easy and I can do it in a few minutes with AM coffee. WHile I still like the old theme, it was purchased from ThemeForest over two years ago and it is showing its age in web years.</description>

We start by cleaning out all the old cobwebs in the corners and strip the structure down to its framework. Just the bare skeleton for now. Thats easy and I can do it in a few minutes with AM coffee. WHile I still like the old theme, it was purchased from ThemeForest over two years ago and it is showing its age in web years. I had fun tweaking it just enough to make it do what I wanted it to do. But it is time to start fresh with some of the good things brought to the web in recent times. Starting fresh does not mean starting from a blank page so I am going to use the excellent <a href="http://320press.com/wpbs/" title="320 Press: WP-Bootstrap Template">wp-bootstrap</a> template and rebuild from there in 2013.</p>

<p>Here is my 2013 list of big things to accomplish:</p>

<ol>
<li>Return focus to my personal site

<ul>
<li>Add more long form posts, sketches and favorite prime photos</li>
<li>Modify the new template to include the images in a functional way and clean up the Tags and  Categories.</li>
<li>Review old drafts and either get rid of them or publish them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write and publish a useful and free iOS app in the app store</li>
<li>180 &amp; Core</li>
<li>Backcountry hunting with a camera &#8211; Mt. Baldy and the spring corn in the Sierra Nevadas</li>
<li>Hit the Sycamore Cyn and Lizard Rock trail systems at least once a month</li>
</ol>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Not the algorithmic kind, the real kind. The kind of sorting that was around long before even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism&#34;&gt;first computer&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, perhaps I had some coins. Coins used to be a popular way to facilitate exchanges. So there we were back when this ancient computer was built. But we didn&amp;#8217;t care about  the computer. I had coins, you had beans, lets talk and make an exchange. Being competitive, I wanted as many of your beans for as few of my coins as possible. And thats where sorting comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not the algorithmic kind, the real kind. The kind of sorting that was around long before even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">first computer</a>. Back then, perhaps I had some coins. Coins used to be a popular way to facilitate exchanges. So there we were back when this ancient computer was built. But we didn&#8217;t care about  the computer. I had coins, you had beans, lets talk and make an exchange. Being competitive, I wanted as many of your beans for as few of my coins as possible. And thats where sorting comes in.</p>

<p>See, I have a handful of coins. And in order to figure out what I am willing to give away &#8211; I need to know what I have. So I sort them into groups and mentally weighted them with value. Gold doubloons? Those are important so I won&#8217;t even bring those out at the exchange of beans for coins.</p>

<p>What else can we sort? Well, I occasionally use cash but prefer not to carry it (However, all my coins go into a little piggy next to the fireplace). Every day, six days a week there might be new mail. Today I tried to be mindful as I checked the mailbox. I know mew housing developments to have them all grouped together at strategic points in the community; and this is nice, but there is something about seeing the corner of a brown envelope sticking out of my mailbox when I drive home.  Enjoying a smile as Hannah asks me if she can check the mail and proceeds to take forever to open it up by telling me she already knows how to do it before accusing me of intentionally not helping me. I know, clearly fuzzy logic at work here And that&#8217;s kind of funny in a memorial sort of way.</p>

<p>Today, I unlocked the (is this a new UserSession?) mailbox and grabbed everything inside. There was an Amazon envelope that was slightly sticking out of the slot and five or six letters to Julie. No big deal. Some days there are no personal items, only local coupons and other bulk mail items. Today, I grabbed (my favorite LayoutStrategy) and put the large envelope on the bottom. Pulling the smaller things out, I organized them into largest on the bottom to smallest on top.</p>

<p>When two or three people (different LayoutStrategies) get mail at the house, I still sort it into the smallest to biggest range until I get inside to start cooking my beans. Then in front of the counter I start with the first item and create mine, Hannah&#8217;s and Julie&#8217;s pile in front of stuff that I am going to toss off to the side.</p>

<p>Anyone can do it. Julie has her own LayoutStrategy&#8217;s that I am sure is different than mine. Hannah, well her LayoutStrategy is random at best but full of energy and entertaining to watch. This is important because a digital analog needs to accommodate this.</p>

<p>There I was on a Friday afternoon standing in the sun with a handful of mail. I saw the mailbox as a stream or a manufacturing conveyer belt. There are digital mechanisms to push a view through the layout strategy And how we do it in real life is related to how we can interact with our data on devices today. Grids are nice for that especially the ones I saw few years ago in  that jQuery plugin (Masonry?). The one that  tiles blocks of content on the page Auto magically. I need something like that for my specialize tableView.</p>

<p>With the belt of mail going by one could drag or flick the piece up or down if they were going horizontally and left or right if they were going up and down. Or drag them from the stream into buckets that live in the navigation controllers.</p>

<p>Even better would be to apply rules to each bucket. Who sent the item? When did I receive the item? Now I can just stuff this into memory and tomorrow I can pick up where I left opart old things happen everyday.  Tomorrow one good thing might be standing under the tree and brushing tufts of tree slough before I open the mailbox. But only if Hannah doesn&#8217;t ask me for my keys. Even if she does I will still get to stand in the sun, close my eyes and breath. I will get a moment to think about things I like about mail.  Things that have very little to do with the process of managing it but the provide a stron anchor for the best things (good news, thank you&#8217;s and new shoes) and spending a (semi) quiet moment with my child. These memories would not be possible without all of the mail items. They relate to the mailbox my parents had when I was smaller.</p>

<p>Somewhere, in the process of managing the physical mail I get, there is life: insights and revelations about those who mean the most, potential for exciting new adventures and data points marking the path of my history. Some of it is the warm comfort in routine and sometimes it is the shock or thrill of discovery as a heart can drop or soar faster than a speeding bullet. I would have gone with faster than the speed of light but I don&#8217;t think the chemical process in our brains is faster.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is Friday and I hope I get my second iPhone in the mail. I stood in line for the very first one and while its been decommissioned after training the next generation for device oriented interaction, I still have it. After the original one I went to Palm until they died or got murdered by incompetence &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure which one is correct. Probably both are but I moved one to try other things for a Moment or two. Now i am almost back where I began. Waiting for an iPhone to go on sale. This time I was smarter about it and skipped the line. It will be nice to check the mail tomorrow and the few days after that if my order took a bit longer to process than the interwebs tell me it did.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The past weekend was busy but more normal than any of the preceding twelve or so. Here is the list of things I did 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past weekend was busy but more normal than any of the preceding twelve or so. Here is the list of things I did 🙂</p>

<ul>
<li>Yard work that forced me to charge up the trimmer and mower and buy a hedge trimmer.

<ul>
<li>Removed two plants that were overgrown and in the way. One will need to be replaced with a rock bed thing because it was under the oustide faucet.</li>
<li>Fixed the entry door lock. Expensive locks are a pain to install or when the door is not drilled straight it is a pain to install the locks. I&#8217;m not sure which one applies to me but when the new front door lock set we got was assembled the latch pice was getting warped and making it difficult to open properly from the inside.</li>
<li>Single track &#8211; I got my bike out and put some air in the tires. It needs some tlc &#8211; brakes are squeaking and the rear detailer is not moving properly up and down the ring. I hit up the trail right by home and boy was it nice to have a trail less than a mile from the garage!</li>
<li>Garage organization &#8211; chaos and order are two ever changing states. Randomly moving things around the garage has helped me organize things that are loosely related and group them together.</li>
<li>I saw a coyote on a trial run Saturday morning. He didn&#8217;t hear me until I spoke to him.</li>
<li>Thought about the performance issues impacting the d/encryption of PII in my iOS app. I think the UIScrollViewDelegate is the path forward.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div>
  With date night at the movies on Saturday (The latest Bourne movie) it felt closer to what a normal weekend is to me.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;A reflection that is two months wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips for working with a moving company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A reflection that is two months wide.</p>

<p>Tips for working with a moving company.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t let them take everything apart. I am sure this line of thought is naive but they are charging by weight, not space or time so it is worth it to me to take care on the sending side to package things up nicely so that one does not to have to reassemble things like shelves for a second time.

<ol>
<li>Mark things with your own tape or stickers. Use phrases like: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Pack&#8221; to remind them that not everything needs to go.</li>
<li>When unloading have them group your rooms together. Even though you are in a new space, your muscle memory will pay off when you look for the things that used to be in the other room.</li>
<li>Keep a list of things that annoy you, are broken or not re-assemblable (like shelves), think about it and figure out which ones are worth discussing. Wait a week and think about each one again before you reach out to the moving company.</li>
<li>Use as much of the old house as you can but play with the arrangements for a few months. Once you settle on a mutually agreeable configuration purge the rest. I am thinking about furniture right now.</li>
<li>If it is your first time supervising take a deep breath, have some coffee and don&#8217;t be shy about telling them how you want it packed. Unless they will guarantee that what they do can be undone by someone else in a week or two months, you will ultimately be the one who has to figure out what they did and try to reverse it. If they guarantee it they are lying to you. It was hard enough to put everything together the first time around, separately. Now you are going to re-assemble everything, in one day with several nice, hard-working dudes who are as completely lacking in assembly instructions as you are?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s always easier to take things apart. Conversely it takes at least twice as long to put everything back together so factor that in when you make you plans for rebuilding your home. It took us about a month from getting started moving on to moving in. I give us at least two months before we get everything back together or stored in a nice place.</p>

<p>I am very happy to have a new home. It was just a house until the movers brought our home in a large truck and we started to make it our own just by mass offloading over 12,00 pounds of boxes. Its weird, I loved the stories like &#8220;On The Road&#8221; and everything that followed but I have always felt strongly for the place and the people at Home. Maybe I like to dream because it is much easier than really traveling. I do like to travel, but it does wear my soul thin and the best places are the ones that call me to linger for a a day, two months, a while.</p>

<p>I think there are lots of places that Hannah needs to linger in the next few years.</p>

            <description>She was born in the California desert and we first met her on our way to Vegas. She was sweet and wiggled alot and had the most beautiful golden colored eyes I ever did see.
She made the trip to Colorado in ought six and then back again this spring. Bouncy and always full of life, even when she was being a little bitchy or taunting horses and cows in the pasture.</description>

Perhaps even more so then. Happy to sit in the sun with Mr. Clyde and <a href="http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/10/gurgis-last-day/" title="Gurgi’s Last Day">Gurgi</a> after him or, she would just flat out run.

            <description>Ah, morning coffee and a nice walk over to the clubhouse. Much better today than yesterday; I was warmer and I felt better. I have about a hundred pictures posted to Google+ that I shared with Family and Friends. Let me know if you can&amp;#8217;t find them.
These are my favorite pictures of the morning.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;#8217;s not a new drug. As we get Bobo ready to travel, we had a few things checked out. You know the things that you have happened and seemed little or odd but have corrected themselves with some rest a time? We have noticed Bobo being sore since Decemberish. I think that was that last time I remember Julie riding him. He has always been sore after being trimmed and there have been a few times when he was to sore to ride. So when the vet that did his Coggins test and other things said he was worried about foundering Julie took notice. Me, I don&amp;#8217;t know much about what that means as I married into horses and am learning as I go. Here are my notes about High Ringbone and what is means for Mr. Bobo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning the farrier, who gave me an excellent crash course into the physics of horse hoof anatomy, told me that he suspected Bobo had arthritis and it was causing High ringbone &amp;#8211; in my layman and unscientific terms is ossification around the top of his pastern bones that causes spurs to form in the front and on the sides where the joint&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I think that was that last time I remember Julie riding him. He has always been sore after being trimmed and there have been a few times when he was to sore to ride.

Me, I don&#8217;t know much about what that means as I married into horses and am learning as I go. Here are my notes about High Ringbone and what is means for Mr. Bobo.</p>

<p>This morning the farrier, who gave me an excellent crash course into the physics of horse hoof anatomy, told me that he suspected Bobo had arthritis and it was causing High ringbone &#8211; in my layman and unscientific terms is ossification around the top of his pastern bones that causes spurs to form in the front and on the sides where the joint</p>

<p>rotates and the ligaments give support.</p>

<p>In the video below, watch the slow motion part and you will see (especially the left hoof) how he flips the toe up at the last minute and then lands on the heel and rolls forward. He is doing that to compensate for the pain. Ironically, that compensation exacerbates the condition casuses the pain in the first place.</p>

<p>The prognosis is a treatable condition. His diagnosis is mild to moderate and it is still early so there are treatments. We are starting with a steroid injection and proper trimming to get his hoof back to the angle it should be so that he doesn&#8217;t have to adjust his walk to compensate for the pain. The injections could give him relief for anywhere between 6 eeks to six months, perhaps more, it just depends on the horse and how he is used. Since Bobo is a pet and the antithesis of a workhorse he enjoys leisurely rides with Hannah. Hopefully we can get him back to gentle trail rides by late fall or early winter. The vet who took the x-rays also recommended something called Bute as a supplement but it needs a prescription so I&#8217;ll wait until Julie can weigh in on what she wants to do with that. I think it is supposed to have an effect sort of like glucosamine but better or more for horses. The Farrier is coming back out early next week and poor Mr. Bobo will be very sore after that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be checking on him regularly and making sure that injection site doesn&#8217;t get infected and also making sure the other horses don&#8217;t pick on him because he has to wear the bandages around his hoofs for a little bit 🙂</p>

<p>Here is the video with the slow motion and still photos that the farrier took, notice how he flips up his toe and then rolls from the heel forward. In the stills you can see the marker lines he made for where the trimming should be, where it currently is and the mid point of the hoof.</p>

            <description>I came across PadMapper.com on Hacker News and being in the market took a look. I liked what I saw, being in the market there is not much to like about the real estate industry. From the way they federate their data and make it as hard as possible for their customers to find what they are looking for, to the cumbersome option selection they provide.
What I liked about PadMappers UI is this:</description>

<p>What I liked about PadMappers UI is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The map is the page, just like if I were to spread a real map out on my table.</li>
<li>The controls are live. I make an adjustment and <strong>the map responds</strong> to me.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I was looking to rent it would be the best housing search experience I can find. How much does zillow charge for access to their feed and can I scrape from the rest of the federated property info? Hmmm.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I friend has been talking about how he wants to use gameification at his employer. One Saturday morning, over coffee I logged into &lt;a href=&#34;http://duolingo.com&#34;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;.com and showed him their interface and demonstrated the elements of gamification in it. Since then they have made several notable enhancements. The most notible technique they use is the owl, Duo. He?She? is pretty cute and expressive enough in response to what I do on the site that I feel something as I interact with the software. When I get busy and the two practice sessions build up I feel guilty because Duo will cry. Ok, not that guilty but enough that I will consciously decide to make time to at least crank through the practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the levels that one can earn by doing lessons and translating real websites. So I can level up and as time has gone on I can follow others and see how I compare &amp;#8211; not in a competitive way but in a &amp;#8220;Wow, how did they get that many points?&amp;#8221; motivational way. Recently I noticed that they enhanced the translating the real web interface so that I can earn more or less points depending on how difficult the&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I friend has been talking about how he wants to use gameification at his employer. One Saturday morning, over coffee I logged into <a href="http://duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>.com and showed him their interface and demonstrated the elements of gamification in it. Since then they have made several notable enhancements. The most notible technique they use is the owl, Duo. He?She? is pretty cute and expressive enough in response to what I do on the site that I feel something as I interact with the software. When I get busy and the two practice sessions build up I feel guilty because Duo will cry. Ok, not that guilty but enough that I will consciously decide to make time to at least crank through the practice sessions.</p>

<p>Then there are the levels that one can earn by doing lessons and translating real websites. So I can level up and as time has gone on I can follow others and see how I compare &#8211; not in a competitive way but in a &#8220;Wow, how did they get that many points?&#8221; motivational way. Recently I noticed that they enhanced the translating the real web interface so that I can earn more or less points depending on how difficult the</p>

<p>translation is. Not only that I can rate others translations after I have done mine and this affects what I think of my translation after I see how others interpreted it. But, and this is important, I can&#8217;t see how well someone else&#8217;s translation has rated with others until after I rate it. Cool huh?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if its coming back but I miss the blur effect. The blur effect was applied to the background image of the sun and the hills (notice the seagulls flying high up in the air). Someone has spent a lot of time making the beautiful artwork besides all the expressive owl postures. So when you went from the home screen to the lesson or game session screen, the background image stayed there but lost clarity and the interface for the session was highlighted. This last observation isn&#8217;t really gamification but from a web development perspective it&#8217;s pretty cool. They also use Backbone.js and thats pretty cool too even though I stll run into trouble with my views on the iOS interpreter, but I don&#8217;t think I am using them correctly.</p>

<p>Have you always wanted to learn a language? Check <a href="http://duolingo.com">it</a> out. I have been consistently learning Spanish since December because of their gamification techniques subtly applied to the interface.</p>]]></content>

            <title>Advice From A Salesman</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Its a cold dark world. When you find a warm light, even a small flicker cup your hands around it and enjoy the warmth. Nurture it &amp;#8211; if its a candle and the wax is almost gone transfer it to a new candle so it can continue to add light to the world. Science, numbers, logic makes me feel warm because it is easy to internalize ones answer as right or wrong. The answer to the math question is either correct or incorrect or, the function you write has the correct output that you need or it doesn&amp;#8217;t. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter how you got to the correct output. For most things in life and business, it only matters that you got to the correct answer for a particular problem. Solving any kind of problem &amp;#8211; even small and trivial ones always makes me feel warm inside and adds flicker to my flame.&lt;/p&gt;

Solving any kind of problem &#8211; even small and trivial ones always makes me feel warm inside and adds flicker to my flame.</p>

<p>Recently I have found myself in an odd position with a problem I am uneducated for and unprepared to solve. Selling my skill set and experience to a range of businesses with unique problems regarding the internet. I like the web and I want to work with web technology to</p>

<p>create solutions for problems people have on the internet. Be they large multinational companies or small niche businesses. They all have problems related to the web that need to be solved. Sure they may have trained themselves or their employees to deal with the pain that are symptoms of these problems. They have processes that mitigate risk and strategy&#8217;s that workaround most of the corner cases. The savings to the bottom line ensure that this will likely continue because that seems to be the path of least resistance. The opportunity here is for someone who can identify the source of the issues and not the symptoms and then focus on fixing or improving the process in a way that doesn&#8217;t require multi-year and multi-billion dollar initiates. Multi-billion dollar initiatives are especially problematic for smaller businesses not yet in the global billion dollar sales market.</p>

<p>So this odd position that I found myself in involved my seeking out people to talk to them about their web problems with the desire to provide a solution. Help if I could or advice if I could not. Being traditionally educated in science and having worked with instruments and technology for a while, my first approach was to provide a list of solutions to the problems I have experience working with. Content management, manipulating graphics or data to present it or store it in novel ways; basically telling the stories of products and companies in the internet with the end goal to increate their profit and by making some type of a sale. This is such a narrow view of what the web is but it was my view until I met with a professional salesman. Someone who has years of experience talking to customers and bridging the gap between customers and technology products. I pseudo gave him my pitch over lunch. I had worked on the language of the slides, memorized them and I had tweaked them based on what I knew and what I thought businesses would need or want to know. In one sentence he invalidated everything I said.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-you-know">How do you know?</h4>

<p>How do you know what they (the potential customer) wants or needs right now? &#8220;Duh, I thought. That makes perfect sense. Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?&#8221; As a light bulb went off in my head. Everything I had worked on and put together to that point was based on my assumptions and my world view of solving problems that I knew already existed. I think I am pretty open minded but here, in this space my vision was narrowly fixated on the assumption that I know more than the customer does. But, as he asked me, &#8220;How do you know?&#8221; And the answer, of course, is that I don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t know what the customers problems are unless we can talk about the customers state of affairs (on the internet) today. I can never truly identify the root cause of an issue is unless I ask enough questions in a way that transcends preconceived notions of what others know or the political ramifications (ie corporate blame games). If I am unable to neutrally identify the root cause then I have no hope of figuring out an acceptable solution. For instance, ask &#8220;Why?&#8221; instead of &#8220;Why do you think..?&#8221; Why takes less time to say and lets the customer explore the problem for themselves. This is much more useful than telling the customer that they solution X because it&#8217;s easy to do Y with it. How do I know X is a problem? I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>He then when on to give me some valuable suggestions for one area that might be common with small business owners: their website.</p>

<p>Start with a conversation about them. They don&#8217;t care about me &#8211; why should they? So ask them about their website and see where it leads. (it helps to also have done a bit or research before hand &#8230; on them and their competitors) Start with some leading questions that will allow them to open up to a person who knows and understands the internet and has a sympathetic ear. Are they happy with their site? Is it still meeting the original goals and objectives? Do they do their own market research and check out the competition? Is there anything that the competition has that they want? Colored their way of course. These are a few examples to start the conversation but could easily be changed for different markets or types of customer.</p>

<p>What these questions do is let the customer open up to you about the little things that cause them pain. Individually not enough pain to force them to address the issues, but when summed up together, all at once, with someone who knows about that pain they might be open to hearing about advancing their technology to solve some of those issues. The benefit of allowing the customer to open up leads the discussion to things most important to the customer. This is very valuable to both the customer and the salesman. If whats most important to the customer aligns with what the salesman can provide then there is a mutual interest, a common ground to explore the problem space more in depth and decide if working together is going to be mutually beneficial. If not, both parties will figure it out and move on with little time wasted.</p>

<p>If I don&#8217;t know what the customer wants, then any advice I give or solutions I provide are going sound pre packaged and hollow at best or condescending and elitest at worst. In trying to sell my skills with web technology, the most important skill I have is the ability to listen and empathize with the little things that kill. Most people do not get worn down by one huge thing that saps all of their energy or takes all of their time during the day. It&#8217;s death by a thousand cuts over the course of the day. My job is to identify the cuts I can prevent for a customer and provide a reasonable solution that will address the problem, not put a band aid over it until tomorrow so they can get cut again.</p>]]></content>

You don&amp;#8217;t need to have aws accounts, you can use the file system but you don&amp;#8217;t know this until you start going through the site setup after the software, db and web server are nicely talking. In my case I got an answer on the irc channel.

<p>My user did own the frontend folder and everything below it and I almost went to irc to ask for advice. As I was typing out my question it occurred to me to manually make the directory myself and reload the page, who knows right?</p>

<p>Lo and behold, it worked. Awesome. Lets continue. After a bit of irc advice to change MAMP&#8217;s MySQL port to 3306 &#8211; I got through the configuration steps and added some photo&#8217;s. Yay!</p>

            <title>Biggest iOS Improvement</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that the updated messaging get a lot of press after the last iOS update. And it is good, from what I have seen Julie do with it. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to wait a bit longer to get some more experience with it when the iPhone 5 comes out. While I still think the webOS did notifications much better they improved it too. If they could only figure out a way to get webOS notifications and something close to the synergy sync that made contact management so painless on webOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this ins&amp;#8217;t about any of that, it is the biggest thing. On the coolness factoer scale the touchstone was by far the coolest thing, not just because of the nice magnet charging base. I think the wireless sync that the last iOS upgrade included is on par with that. Hannah got a new Barbie movie on DVD last weekend. So I ripped it on my laptop and transfered the file over to the mini hooked up to the tv that is used to sync the iOS devices of my to lovely ladies. Once it was on there and copied into Julies iTUnes library it was trivial to push&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Once it was on there and copied into Julies iTUnes library it was trivial to push</p>

<p>it out to both the iPad plugged in upstairs and the iPod Touch in Hannahs room. mark a checkbox, take off some My LIttle Pony&#8217;s for the Touch and hit sync. Now she has it there and she can watch it on the TV. That was painless, easy and makes it accessible to her on three different devices. I know iCloud is supposed to do something similar but after my experiences with .mac and MobileM, lets just say I&#8217;m skeptical and will wait for them to work the bugs out before I ride that train.</p>

<p>One thing could make it cooler &#8211; an awesome induction charging station for the pretty iOS devices. I can see them hanging rom the wall next my bed or in the office. Replacing the thermostat once more companies can do what the Tendril Platform can do for consumers (although the electrical companies need to cooperate and I think their organizations are too old and outdated to see the potential locked up in freeing a consumers data to the consumer. They are going to likely take the music/book/movie approach and nickel and dime their customers until they eventually get replaced). Anyway, a shiny new iPad3 with induction charging dock station mounted to my wall, thats what I see. I wonder if it is possible?</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying to sleep in the other day. Usually, up and at &amp;#8217;em by 6:30 I was stalling. I think it was related to the time change. I have never been a fan of it and it throws everything off for a few days. Even Hannah was up later than usual. I wanted to lay still for a while longer and read some more of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s funny how unconnected things can link together in related ways. Yesterday&amp;#8217;s trip to the Butterfly Pavilion and the free kit in cellophane that Hannah got, kinderart projects and learning about animals and bugs combined witha bit of parental laziness and desire for just a few more minutes of morning quiet time lying still unexpectedly gave me a great present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lie still for a few more moments, we had to convince Hannah to be a bit more autonomous. The easiest way to do this is with the iPad because it is bigger than her touch and the games are more fun on it. &amp;#8220;Hannah, do you want to take the iPad and Whitney into your room for a little while longer?&amp;#8221; When she is not asking me to make pancakes, she&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have never been a fan of it and it throws everything off for a few days. Even Hannah was up later than usual. I wanted to lay still for a while longer and read some more of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation</a>. It&#8217;s funny how unconnected things can link together in related ways. Yesterday&#8217;s trip to the Butterfly Pavilion and the free kit in cellophane that Hannah got, kinderart projects and learning about animals and bugs combined witha bit of parental laziness and desire for just a few more minutes of morning quiet time lying still unexpectedly gave me a great present.</p>

<p>In order to lie still for a few more moments, we had to convince Hannah to be a bit more autonomous. The easiest way to do this is with the iPad because it is bigger than her touch and the games are more fun on it. &#8220;Hannah, do you want to take the iPad and Whitney into your room for a little while longer?&#8221; When she is not asking me to make pancakes, she</p>

<p>usually replies, &#8220;OK&#8221; and she willjump off the bed, grab the iPad and disappear for at least fifteen more minutes. Sometimes she will even let Whitney out but that is not a sure thing.</p>

<p>She disappeared and a few minutes went by. Silence. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Not sure but figuring that I would be sure to hear about it if there was a problem I got a little lost in the Foundation Traders section; all the while, somewhere in the back of my mind I was wondering what she was up to.</p>

<p>The kinderart that she comes home with can range from printed out pages for coloring to elaborate creations of things like butterfly&#8217;s with cloths pins and construction paper. I wasn&#8217;t even aware of the butterfly one until today when I was cleaning up her artwork area. I knew she has been learning about animals and they were talking insects this morning when we got there at 9am. (She slept to 8am &#8211; yay useless time change) Yesterday, I was trying to get just a few more pages in before the day started when I heard her coming up the stairs. I figured I would soon know what she had been up to and started preparing mysel f to make pancakes.</p>

<p>She announced that she made butterfly&#8217;s for everyone. What she did, was adapt the cloths pin + construction paper idea to the cellophane + (butterfly) barrettes. She even colored the cellophane &#8216;wings.&#8217; What she had done was cut up the cellophane into a semi circular or rectangular shape and twisted it in the middle. Then she closed the butterfly barrette ove the middle and voila! butterfly&#8217;s. What is amazing to me is that unprompted she took an idea from a week or more ago and adapted it to the materials she had on hand. The result was the coolest wake up gift I have ever gotten.</p>

<p>I am still amazed with the extremely fast rate that Hannah and her friends learn things and pass information amongst themselves. This was something new to me and is on a different level. She is taking abstract ideas (I want to mke more butterfly&#8217;s like we made in schooll a week a go) and adapting them to make something with the material she has on hand. That spark of creativity exists as an idea in her head and she draws on her experience to marry the idea with something previously experienced.</p>

<p>What I want to know is, where does this <a href="http://matt.hippeelee.com/#/5">spark</a> come from and how can I help her continue to develop it. Helping her continue to develop it is a bit challenging because, lately, everything I do and say is wrong or she is better than me by default 🙂 If I try to push her into being creative the way I think creativity works she seems to dig in her heels and tells me &#8220;No, thats wrong&#8221; or just gets bored and wants to move onto something else. If I try to leave her alone to explore things she still gets bored and says, &#8220;Daddy, will you play a game with me?&#8221; I wish there was an algorithm that made it easy to identify opportunities to push her to autonomously do things that spark her interest in a creative way and identify the times when it is better to structure the &#8216;games&#8217; that we play so that I can show her how I do creativity. I have a feeling this algorithm could be usefully applied to situations outside parenthood.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Accepting a job offer from an unknown quantity has many consequences down the line on your career. Good managers/teams/companies will help you build up a network of assets and resources long after have moved up and on in your career. To look out for you long term career goals and aspirations you need to go beyond the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m willing to take any job or position that I am buzzword qualified for.&amp;#8221; You need to identify the best managers/teams and companies that are thinking about their long term vision and understand how new employees fit into that. Here are seven questions I will work into my future interviews for full time employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you interested in Hiring me and what do you know about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers that truly have an interest in hiring the best person for the job will take the time to research their top candidates. They will do a google search for you, check you out on LinkedIn and consider the skills you have that can make their team or organization successful. Uninterested managers will either not consider you a top candidate and be interviewing you to meet an HR requirement or, they will be looking to associate your skills&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Good managers/teams/companies will help you build up a network of assets and resources long after have moved up and on in your career. To look out for you long term career goals and aspirations you need to go beyond the &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to take any job or position that I am buzzword qualified for.&#8221; You need to identify the best managers/teams and companies that are thinking about their long term vision and understand how new employees fit into that. Here are seven questions I will work into my future interviews for full time employment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you interested in Hiring me and what do you know about me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Managers that truly have an interest in hiring the best person for the job will take the time to research their top candidates. They will do a google search for you, check you out on LinkedIn and consider the skills you have that can make their team or organization successful. Uninterested managers will either not consider you a top candidate and be interviewing you to meet an HR requirement or, they will be looking to associate your skills</p>

<p>with the buzzwords that describe the role they need filled. Associating skills for a role with buzzwords on a resume is only a tier one filter. If they cannot do more to filter the list of prospective new hires, how much effort do you think they will put into integrating you into their team or helping you advance your skill set and thus your career?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see that your company uses <insert technology buzzword here>. How does this role use <buzzword> on a daily basis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An answer to this question will tease out useful knowledge that you can use to make an objective decision when you get an offer. In programming it might tell you if the company sees its work as making yet another crud app or applying knowledge to solve problems creatively and address real human problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you like most/least about my experience or skills?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will tell you what type of a manager or team you are interviewing with. Good managers will know and articulate specific reasons why they are interested in having you work for them. Good managers will also be able to voice their concerns with hiring you. This tells you several things. What type of communication and management skill your potential employer has. It could also help you identify your weak areas that you have not identified. As someone who is very big on self reflection and introspection, I find the most useful feedback comes from people who can critique my work/idea/performance and offer suggestions for improvement. The least useful feedback is criticism. It is s fine line between the two. Perhaps what separates them is that (I think) critique will focus on the work/idea/performance and integrate tips for improvement and criticism will focus on the person. &#8220;You did this or can&#8217;t do that&#8221; instead of &#8220;That&#8217;s an inefficient way to solve that problem because you were using technology unknown to you in a relatively new environment.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the most interesting and creative aspect of this role? Of this company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to work for employers who have motivating challenges to work on. Even yet another crud (create, read, update and delete &#8211; information from the database) app can have interesting business logic and open up opportunities to apply a little bit of creativity. You want to work with a team that can find and describe the interesting aspects of the problem and focuses on that over the mundane aspects that all things called work have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the last person leave this position and may I speak with them? Or, who was the last employee or team member to leave your group, why, and, can I speak with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hiring managers and teams that are well run will have an ample supply of &#8216;references&#8217; that will be able to tell you why the opportunity is such a great one. These will be folks who have moved on through advancement or career change but they will not be able to say enough good things about the manager or team you might be joining. Managers and teams that experience high turnover do so for a good reason and they will not have nearly the same level of enthusiasm from those who have moved on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would you descrive the environment for this role/team/company?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a web development I am looking for a high level description of the development process that includes &#8211; development philosophy (agile, scrum, waterfall, none???) to the tool chain used to build the product. What kind of source control do they use, why? How did they arrive at the infrastructure (servers, databases and programming languages oh my) that a product is architected with? This gives you insight to the soft skills that complement the technical ones. Are their business processes clearly defined and can the manager or team talk about them comfortably at a high level? This important to identifying good managers, teams and companies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me about one failure or mistake you (or the tema if it is a group interview) have made in the past year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Employers always ask prospective employees this question but it works both ways. Managers and teams that are willing to admit to failure (technical, managerial, or otherwise) will aslo be able to tell you what they learned from it. This tells you that they understand the dynamic nature of problem solving and that they will be able to support you when you make a mistake to help you learn and grow from it</p>

            <title>The New Slideshow</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have come across several neat JavaScript programs that take advantage of all the CSS3 fun you can do in modern browsers. Each time I see a new one idas go racing through my head. I can do this or that or &amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I got one of those mailer brochures from a credit card company with pretty images and pithy tag lines telling me all about their product. I don&amp;#8217;t need any more credit cards right now. But it did get me thinking, how could I do this on a webpage? So I marked it up with one of Hannah&amp;#8217;s pens into some simple markup for the different pieces on each page and put it on my desk. Then I cleaned the office and tossed it. However, the idea continued to roll around in my head and about a week later I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thestartupofyou.com/&#34;&gt;The Start Up Of You&lt;/a&gt;. I joined the group on LinkedIn. Why not, I have been spending quite a bit of time on there looking for reasonable jobs lately.

<p>A couple weeks ago I got one of those mailer brochures from a credit card company with pretty images and pithy tag lines telling me all about their product. I don&#8217;t need any more credit cards right now. But it did get me thinking, how could I do this on a webpage? So I marked it up with one of Hannah&#8217;s pens into some simple markup for the different pieces on each page and put it on my desk. Then I cleaned the office and tossed it. However, the idea continued to roll around in my head and about a week later I finished reading <a href="http://www.thestartupofyou.com/">The Start Up Of You</a>. I joined the group on LinkedIn. Why not, I have been spending quite a bit of time on there looking for reasonable jobs lately. So it was easy to join and nice to come across variations of ideas in the book as well as intelligent discussion about how to</p>

<p>apply them.</p>

<p>Then, last week I got involved in a discussion thread about the benefits of soft assets online. Things like a personal and professional blog or a portfolio. Should you have one, should you keep personal and professional separate online? Things like that &#8211; it was an interesting discussion that kept waking me up at 5:30am. It brought up this question in my mind: Why not create a digital brochure with one of the cool JavaScript tools out there as a self promotional piece. I finally sat down and put something together with <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js">Reveal.js</a>. I think it was the combination of the digital brochure idea coupled with the advice to learn how to better promote myself and a desire to create something that I thought was cool. The idea is not a resume, not a cover letter. Those things need to be specifically crafted for an employer and I rarely use the general core version that is <a href="http://hire.hippeelee.com" target="_blank">here</a> as it is. Plus, I don&#8217;t think resumes and cover letters are very cool and these days, the importance of them is a little suspect with all the buzz word filters out there.</p>

<p>The idea is to create my own marketing collateral as part of a larger campaign. Get what I saw inside my head, a merger of some of the favorite photographs I have taken over the past few years with a tag line or phrase that reflects my personality, and make it into a digital brochure of sorts. After getting a bit of feedback that helped guide the removal of things not needed, I ended up with 7 slides, one even has an attempt at a haiku poem. I modified Reveal just a bit. I needed to slow down the transitions and I also wanted to make my slides full screen. Thats how I saw it in my head. After gauging a reaction and some feedback I am not sure if that works or not. Digging through the source though it might be possible to add a setting that makes each slide &#8220;full screen&#8221; (not the OSX full screen), just the full size of the window.</p>

<p>Anyway, in parlance with the theme of permanent beta in The Start Up Of You, I put it up on its own site <a href="http://matt.hippeelee.com" target="_blank">here</a>. While not on par with an Apple marketing campaign, I think its a good start to reflecting out some of the things I see inside and I can always continue to iterate on it as I change or get good feedback. There were some good questions fed back to me that I still don&#8217;t have a good answer to. Who is the target audience? I don&#8217;t know yet. Why would I send them a link to that piece and what am I trying to say? Well, that one I do know, sort of. I wanted to communicate technical competence (implementing the slideshow, the keyboard navigation and simple transforms with flexible content) and include an abstract, creative element in the words chosen for each image, where some of the phrases were placed and how they moved when you resize the window. I&#8217;m not sure if it worked but it was good to be making something.</p>

<p>Two things came out of this. Well, three if you <a href="http://matt.hippeelee.com">include the actual page</a> itself. I liked the challenge of finding images that speak to me and figuring out what they say to me. There has to be something else I can do with this concept &#8211; snowboarding, nature, politics? Hmmm, nature or politics shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. The catch is I have to use my own images for the message. The second thing is that I should modify Reveal so that I don&#8217;t have to do the full window size in the css. Make it just another option to pass in when Reveal is initialized.</p>]]></content>

            <title>An Easy Toolchain</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I learned about tools from my dad. He used to fix everything us kiddos broke around the house and the cars and other engine driven things we used. I remember he had a method that included starting from the problem and working backwards through the solution. I spent alot of time bored out of my mind, holding his tools. Sometimes I was sent to get different tools but usually he brought a couple of different general purpose tools and was able to make due with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its funny, the more I learn about software and software development, even from a web slanted view, it all depends on the tools you use. It depends on the tools that work best with your style. I have been keeping my personal projects and org-mode files under version control at bitbucket with mercurial for a few years now and while not completely immersed in the distributed version control environment, I am drawn to the benefits of it. Namely being able to commit to my repo whenever and whereever I am internt access or no internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I ramp up the search for opportunities in the next phase there are a lot of things I still need&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Its funny, the more I learn about software and software development, even from a web slanted view, it all depends on the tools you use. It depends on the tools that work best with your style. I have been keeping my personal projects and org-mode files under version control at bitbucket with mercurial for a few years now and while not completely immersed in the distributed version control environment, I am drawn to the benefits of it. Namely being able to commit to my repo whenever and whereever I am internt access or no internet access.</p>

<p>As I ramp up the search for opportunities in the next phase there are a lot of things I still need</p>

<p>to process but publishing my resume online, branded as me and independent of everything else is the most important thing I need to maintain right now. I have very specific requirements and even more functionality that I am going to add so it makes sense to put it under version control, even if it only starts out at html/css/JavaScript. Since bluehost already has git installed for me to use and, fortuitously, since bitbucket started offering git as an option when creating a new repository, I put the first version in there.</p>

<p>The past few days I have gotten it to the point where I am comfortable publishing it and sending out some requests for feedback on the content and behavior of the layout. You know how it is though, especially with projects that are personal: you always find little things that need tweaked. I found the ease of deployment for a static html site super easy with git. Make a change on my laptop, test it in the different browsers and use the iOS Simulator to take a look at iPad and iPhone browsers. Who knows what someone might use to look at that page when I start using it to market myself. So I make some tweaks, some small, some bigger &#8211; I had to script a few changes for the iPhone because the screen is so small. I commit a series of changes and push a changeset. Then, and this is what I think is great &#8211; I ssh into my bluehost account and change to the online resume directory and all I have to do is git pull. There is no ftp all the files over to the webserver, there is no scp a tarball, delete the old files and unpack the new ones. It is just update the live version and go on about my day.</p>

<p>The importance of tools in helping me is no different than the ones my dad has that he used to build, fix and modify the home I grew up in. The parallells between the real world and the digital world amaze me and the skills I saw Dad use to troubleshoot still apply, even though the tools in play are completely different.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit here and try to see what it is that I want I see hazy unfocused shapes moving around in a milky white fog. What is it I need to do and how do I want to get that done? There is more than just the gears behind the clock face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes quite a bit of time to put the shortest bit of delight together. Delight that is fleeting only because of the amount of thought and attention to detail that went into it. Take &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/julie/vday&#34;&gt;cards&lt;/a&gt; for example. No matter where they are found there is far more time in preparing them for consumption that the actual consumption which could only be a few seconds. They comunicate ideas and emotions simply (at least my favorite ones do) and they do it with extreme efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the last card you gave. Most likely, you picked it up at a store, signed your name to it and sent it on its way. Perhaps you took the time to write a more personal note. All of the hard stuff was done for you: which card stock to use, how many colors to use in the graphic design on the front in inside,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It takes quite a bit of time to put the shortest bit of delight together. Delight that is fleeting only because of the amount of thought and attention to detail that went into it. Take <a href="http://hippeelee.com/julie/vday">cards</a> for example. No matter where they are found there is far more time in preparing them for consumption that the actual consumption which could only be a few seconds. They comunicate ideas and emotions simply (at least my favorite ones do) and they do it with extreme efficiency.</p>

<p>Think about the last card you gave. Most likely, you picked it up at a store, signed your name to it and sent it on its way. Perhaps you took the time to write a more personal note. All of the hard stuff was done for you: which card stock to use, how many colors to use in the graphic design on the front in inside,</p>

<p>which words to print for the genre of card. Once all of those decisions had been made it was easy to print that line of cards off so you can jot down a little, extra note and your signature.</p>

<p>Then, in even less time the recipient gets a personalized idea or emotion straight from you. Depending on how many words this happens in seconds and knowledge is transferred from you to them.</p>

<p>I think about this because I am looking for a system that will let me share specifically targeted information about myself in a similar but much more modern fashion and it helps to start with my eyes closed. Are the bits of information visible to start with or just really small? How do they enter the awareness of the audience? Is it scale or transformation or both. Is it still minimal if they do both with some skewing?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure yet but one thing I know. Being able to prototype my page using the browser console is very useful.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I had some issues that affected my productivity with google applications in Chrome I re-configured my system to use native apps for chat, mail and calendar. Overall I like the changes and the trade off is worth it since I do not have to log into my google account 30 times a day. I miss using one browser (especially with the three finger swipe down that shows me all of my tabs) but I still use it for development and other browsing. Seriously I counted the last day and it was 30 times google asked me to log in in chrome so I don&amp;#8217;t mind having all my apps in one place. Oddly, firefox and safari do not have this incessant logging in to google services issue with google services. Weird, I know. But I think I&amp;#8217;ll stick with Safari for my work apps accounts for now and use the native apps with personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my point. I was restoring some music to my itunes library and when I dragged and dropped it onto the itunes application I noticed that instead of asking me to choose and drag to Music or Movies, etc; it just highlighted the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>section around all the Library categories and let me drop. There was no more thinking required on my part. That may be an important part of understanding how to do UX well. First identify the choices a user makes with your system. Then identify the repetitive choices they have to make that require a very low level of thought and make that choice for them. In my case I was dragging music files into iTunes. A while ago I remember I had to get the drag to highlight Music in the Library. Now I don&#8217;t, iTunes just highlights all categories under Library and I drop the files off.</p>

<p>It makes sense. I know or think I have a file I can add to my Library, They let me know if I can add the files by highlighted all of the Library Categories and then make it easy to drop them off and figure out where to put them and how to identify them. One less low level but conscious choice I need to make.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I&amp;#8217;m impressed, iPhoto&amp;#8217;s facial recognition software can also id the moon. I mean, I have always known that there was a man on the moon and that when it was full there was an eye and nose that are clearly visible so I guess it would be a good training object.Is This The Moon?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the kiddo bench with tape.&lt;/strong&gt; There was an issue with the Ikea bench after four years of heavy use. Hannah informed us that it broke but she didn&amp;#8217;t break it. As a proactive measure though, she fixed it with tape. How creative I think to myself when we had this conversation. And, how awesome to get to witness that comprehension, observe her growth in understanding. Maybe it is just me but the observational apsect of being a parent is fascinating. As for Hannah, she knows tape is sticky and that one can tape things together. The bench needs something sticky to keep it securely on. That makes sense. If I knew what she knows I think I would do the same. Of all the things I ever thought were cool, this is up there as the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong>Decorate the fish tank.</strong> There was a morning tummy ache yesterday. Julie stayed home with H but still had to do some work stuff. I guess she was on a conference call when Hannah decorated the fish tank. There is tha card we got from John and Lori after Grugi died and some kinderart to start with. I think the fishy&#8217;s will enjoy the</p>

<p>change of scenery. I would if I only traveled through 10 gallons of water. The rainbow came later and there was also a handprint turkey but I couldn&#8217;t work it into the shot.</p>

<p><strong>Tonight,</strong> she put <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> eaten cheese back into its wax and back into the fridge. I had a one of those little pads of cheese that come sealed in wax so Hannah had one. Then she had another. As I was eating dinner I noticed the second one on the table. Hannah was long gone and I was cleaning up when I looked in it. She had nibbled around a quarter of the edge and then put it back into the wax and folded it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look what our daughter did.&#8221; I said and handed it to Julie.</p>

<p>She just laughed that laugh of hers that I like so much.</p>

<p>Later when Hannah wandered through the kitchen I she decided that we should keep it and put it into her drawer in the fridge. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll eat it later.&#8221;</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gave up on using chrome for google apps. Ever since they opened up google+ for public use they changed something about the authentication system and my computer running chrome really does not like it. It makes me log in to each app multiple times per day. Intermittently I would get the you must enable javascript or clearn you cache and cookies blah blah blah. Well its been several months and JavaScript has always been enabled. I think my cache and cookies are clear enough to fry an egg on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have even tried to uninstall and re-install but not that the time spent trying to figure out why wants me to log in for each app, multiple time a day it is time to use tool that don&amp;#8217;t get in the way of what I need or want to do and re-logging into a web service multiple times a day is not what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went back to firefox for google plus and the document s. I am going to use apples mail and cal apps for those accounts. I guess the plus side is that I don&amp;#8217;t need to see any of the adds &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>not that they really bother me that much. It&#8217;s been a while since I used them so we will see if I like the changes to the native apps.</p>

<p>For web development Chrome is the best browser right now, ironically for me, whatever changes they have been making to it have rendered it completely unusable to me for their web apple (mail.cal/documents etc) in Chrome because of this weird log in issue for their web apps.</p>

<p>Odd is on his lane tonight. Must bee the moon or electromagnetic interference that is causing this oddness. It must be.</p>]]></content>

            <description>This year Hannah had her Holiday concert. She and her class were organized and on tempo with the music. Along with her questions about Santa she is truly beginning to understand the world she moves through. I liked how she fiddled with her antlers, I am sure I ould have done the same if I could have even kept them on my head.
I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod.</description>

<p>I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod. Try as ia might and hard as I could the video was jerky and shaky. The stills are better than that and perhaps another way to deal with shaky video is to just extract the sound and take good stills? No, I still want a tripod so I can get decent video when I want to.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In my second experience with Fandango I like them even worse. We won&amp;#8217;t focus on the lack of usability on their website but to say that it was less than optimal and more than painful to get the information I was trying to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this sub par experience with them is the Google Offers (I&amp;#8217;m not sold on the whole internet coupons as a value proposition for myself either but Julie is a bit more trusting than I am) Fandango tickets we purchased and can&amp;#8217;t use because they are expiring before we can use them at a different theater later this week. We already made plans to meet other folks at a specific theater but unfortunately for us crapdango tells me that &lt;strong&gt;Online Ticketing Not Available for this Theater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh, so let me get this straight, they sell movie tickets but when I want to buy them they can&amp;#8217;t sell them to me. I recall the first time I balked because they tried to force me to register for an account and charge me an extra couple of dollars for tickets. I guess I&amp;#8217;m at a loss to the value they provide. I have never had a hard time getting tickets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Huh, so let me get this straight, they sell movie tickets but when I want to buy them they can&#8217;t sell them to me. I recall the first time I balked because they tried to force me to register for an account and charge me an extra couple of dollars for tickets. I guess I&#8217;m at a loss to the value they provide. I have never had a hard time getting tickets</p>

<p>to a movie at the door so why would I pay them extra to send some digital bits over the internet for me to not have to pull out my credit card?</p>

<p>Fast forwarding to tonight it is a little frustrating that they would sell a coupon that is not easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that some of it may be due to us not reading the fine print (who does and is not a lawyer?) or being regular customers of theirs but with regards to what I dislike about the whole online coupon fad is that the seller has all the upside. If for any reason I am unable to use the coupon I am out everything and this is very different from how coupons used to be when they were clipped from dead trees. There was no risk to me and I wouldn&#8217;t mind giving them my information in exchange for a better deal that I could normally get.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I will be able to talk Julie out of even considering them again with a simple &#8220;I&#8217;s just not worth the hassel to try and work with them so we can save a few dollars.&#8221; I know I&#8217;ll avoid them like the plague whenever I do anything movie related and be happy they don&#8217;t have a change to put any dark light on my movie experience. Their website and service is confusing and hard to use and they offered a coupon that was impossible to use. I wonder how this works for them, it took them over five years to get $5 from us. Going forward not only will we avoid their services but I&#8217;ll have a written memory of specific reasons you should also avoid them. It&#8217;s just not worth your time and they can&#8217;t save you any money.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I have been struggling with the default install of ffmpeg on centOS5 and went to HandbrakeCLI for easy conversion. However, we need a tool that will convert videos for web (this means x264 and other formats for chrome) and iOS devices.
The stock yum install of ffmpeg on centos (i386) is at 0.6ish. I think its time to upgrade our servers because trying to create webm video is just not working.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.</p>

<p>Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did</p>

<p>we have a good night. We had mac n&#8217; cheese and she had some other snacks while I made a turkey meatball sandwich. Then we playes some card games &#8211; war. Hannah does not like to lose. She tried to talk me into giving her my jokers (which in our games is higher tan an ace). First she asked outright, then she tried some sweetness. I told her no way, that the game wouldn&#8217;t be fun for me if I knew I was going to be lose but that&#8217;s not entirely true. I just didn&#8217;t want to explicitly give them to her. she just happened win my best cards in a series of wars and double wars. Then we watched the first half of the animated movie &#8216;Rango&#8217;. At around 7pm, we went upstairs to play another game and get ready for night nights.</p>

<p>After she got ready I sent her to get the next game. It turned out to be the story telling card game. I think she got it for her birthday. We played it like this. You lay the cards out in a grid and then get lucky when Julie comes home to join us. Each person takes a turn and picks three cards. Then they make up a story with forests and castles and animals and princesses and lakes and happy endings with ever afters. Then the next person goes until all the cards in the grid layed out are gone. It worked out that the deck was evenly divisible by three and Hannh told the last story.</p>

<p>Julie finished off night nights and I went downstarts for a pleasant surprise. I watched the movie &#8216;Ink.&#8217; It streams from netflix and I would highly recommend it. Its a low budget but creatively produced story. The beginning is very weird and a little creepy. Actually, it was a lot creepy but I think that is because it deals with a sensitive subject matter with the focus on the child/childhood aspects of life. As the creepiness fades away the story progresses past the battle between goon and evil and develops characters that are real by highlighting a series of those important moments that sear themselves into out minds as memories. I won&#8217;t spoil it but I really liked it and the only movie I can compare it to is &#8216;Pans Labyrinth&#8217; or &#8216;The Devils Backbone&#8217; by Guillermo del Toro. Creepy, fantastical in a way that is most poignant during the transition between childhood innocence and grown up realization.</p>

<p>Going to sleep I felt a twitch in my Idea Muscle. I want to reccomend this movie as well as others like Pans Labyrinth and The Devils Backbone but she is only four. As vivid as her dreams must be adding really scary monsters into the mix does not seem like a recipe for a good night sleep for either of her parental units. So the problem is how do I recommend these movies to her, leave her a digital eater egg that is not depended on a code like easter eggs in video games are triggered. I think it should be triggered by her age &#8211; when she is eighteen to twentish how do I give her access to this thought but keep it hidden from her until she is ready. Ready as I understand it?</p>

<p>This idea of digital easter eggs is interesting because it might not just be limited to linear time and I wonder if they approach it in video games as how the user wanders through the story &#8230; as they gain proficiency they unlock more game areas. So it&#8217;s not just time but my main use case is time. It will take time for Hannah to grow and mature enough to watch a movie like &#8216;Ink.&#8217; I think that average is about nineteen years old. She will be able to handle the scary creepiness and understand the subtle story that develops behind it.</p>

<p>The digital easter eggs are more than just movie and book recommendations that I want to leave for her. Advice that occurs to me for her sometimes goes unsaid simply because she is not focused enough to understand it or it&#8217;s just not appropriate to discuss some aspects of life and love. Dud, but someday she will have questions and I want to make my thoughts now available to the Hannah in the future. With this idea of a personal digital archive that is passed on to my future generations how do you give someone age appropriate access &#8211; even better, how do I give age appropriate access to nine generations from now? I believe that it is important to know my ancestors and I was better off because I was lucky enough to have two sets of grandparents. But past them I don&#8217;t know a whole lot about my ancestors &#8230; I know a bit about where they were from but nothing about the wealth of conventional wisdom they must have accumulated during their lives.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should state it more simply like this with Hannah in mind: I want a tool that lets me leave advice, tips, tricks and knowledge that I think is important. This information can range from good books and movies to read (and why I think so) to relationship and career advice. All of this needs to be reveled to the user in layers that are age (context?) appropriate. Also, this information is very likely highly personal and not for public consumption the way blogs and social media has evolved the concept of sharing. Facebook at least seems to believe that if one has something to say you should say it to everyone &#8211; even if thats only so they can make money. I doubt they are concerned about providing tools to pass on the wealth of digital information that we accumulate to nine generations down the line. Thats what I want to do. I want my children&#8217;s grandchildren&#8217;s grandchildren&#8217;s children (can you spot the palindrome) to be able to discover things that are important to me.</p>

<p>It was an odd day. One where early morning interactions with my daughter lead to thoughts of empathy for the users which circled back to reflections of my interactions with my daughter that were triggered and inspired by a science fiction/fantasy movie about good and evil &#8211; there were many pleasant surprises today.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was Hannahs first day in the PreK class at primrose. Complete with new jumper uniform and excitement that bounced &amp;#8211; she grows up one milestone at a time and all to fast. When she tries my patience and wants to &amp;#8216;play games&amp;#8217; at 5:15 in the morning it helps me to remember that she won&amp;#8217;t always want me to play with her and these opportunities are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, Julie was trying to take a picture of her but Hannah was being camera shy. I know she missed the cutoff date because of her birthday but something tells me that it is going to be up to me and Julie to keep her interested in learning the things that spark her creativity and interests. With the realization that there is never a good time to raise taxes but the general public doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to understand that you get what you pay for. If we cut budgets and funding for teachers and education we will get what we pay for. While I can vote for things like Colorado&amp;#8217;s prop 103 because I believe in it there isn&amp;#8217;t much I can do to help increase funding for schools. What I can do is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>pay attention to Hannah as she grows and nurture her interests with useful knowledge that builds on the basics. Hopefully her schools will be able to teach her those.</p>

<p>So far her biggest interests include doing art projects: painting, coloring, cutting and stapeling and taping paper together, and singing. She really does enjoy singing and she even knows some words to Jack Johnson songs and when she gets excited she will bounce around the room without stopping. Going and going she seems to have an endless supply of (unfocused) energy. It is my job to teach her how to focus.</p>]]></content>

            <description>We went to the zoo this morning for the annual trick-or-treat session. It was a little crazy with amostt 20 people and over half of us kiddos. This doesn&amp;#8217;t count grown up kiddos, only kiddos of legal age.
There were a few dramatic moments but overall thhings went pretty smoothly and we stopped at Cinzetti&amp;#8217;s Resturaunt for lunch. There is no better place to go with 10+ hungery, sugar overloaded kiddos.</description>

            <description>I took Hannah over to the pumpkin patch hosted at the Vista Ridge Community center. We did everything. We decorated yet another pumpkin &amp;#8230; I think we should make seeds but have yet to google a good process for cleaning and roasting the seeds. We hit the jumpy spiderman bounce house and talked to some nice people from the neighborhood. Then, some of Hannahs other lilac circle friends showed up and she helped them decorate.</description>

<p>On our way home we stopped at 711 and got some gase, a belly buster and poweraid because there wasn&#8217;t much to drink there and we were thirsty. Yum. Now it is off to a halloween party hosted by primrose friends.</p>

            <description>I made a pdf of Hannahs Number Book that she brought home from school. She proudly showed me the numbers and described the images. I think she did a great job drawing the different objects.
I like that her favorite number is 1. Mine are in no particular order: 11, 19 and 29.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight Hannah and I did LiteBrite instead of reading books for night nights. She sometimes does that &amp;#8230; &amp;#8216;Papa, can we play a game instead of read books tonight?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the drama classes kicked in and she got upset at me. I make deals with her. Tonight the deal was for her to wait in bed for me to come back with my guitar and play her a song after I went to brush my teeth and do shot shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little bunny did not stay in her bed and the deal was off. This was upsetting and I understand. I also understand that we don&amp;#8217;t always get what we want. I think it&amp;#8217;s my job as a parent to teach Hannah that but I&amp;#8217;m not sure. They forgot the manual when were came home with her four years ago. I think that its not just teaching her that we don&amp;#8217;t always get what we want but that when a decision has been made there isn&amp;#8217;t much use crying over it. Has anyone ever been able to teach this to a four year old girl? I don&amp;#8217;t know, me I&amp;#8217;ll just keep chipping away at her subconscious. I know that I&amp;#8217;ll be&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cool crisp fall day. The storms of the day before had moved of to the east. We got up early with the sunrise and had a simple breakfast. Toast for me and scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and grilled chicken for you. Sitting around is never good for the soul so we went out to Mr BoBo. Hannah rode in the arena and you and Whitney chased him for a bit, like you always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back home and I took care of a few things around the house. Once I got done I joined you and Whitney out on the deck with my guitar. You sat in the sun the way you always did. Upright on your haunches you enjoyed the view across the valley all the way over to the mountains. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s just boxers but when you sat there stoically and sweetly it just killed me that you were in such dire straits. As I played the song you came over to sit next to me and sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was my birthday and the best wife ever was going to a rock show (Foo Fighters) with me, we set you&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Toast for me and scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and grilled chicken for you. Sitting around is never good for the soul so we went out to Mr BoBo. Hannah rode in the arena and you and Whitney chased him for a bit, like you always do.</p>

<p>We came back home and I took care of a few things around the house. Once I got done I joined you and Whitney out on the deck with my guitar. You sat in the sun the way you always did. Upright on your haunches you enjoyed the view across the valley all the way over to the mountains. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just boxers but when you sat there stoically and sweetly it just killed me that you were in such dire straits. As I played the song you came over to sit next to me and sniffed.</p>

<p>Since it was my birthday and the best wife ever was going to a rock show (Foo Fighters) with me, we set you</p>

<p>and Whitney up inside so that you could make yourself comfortable. We met Katie down in Denver for dinner and the show but most of the time I was thinking about you. The show rocked and we got home later than I thought. The band played for two and a half hours at least.</p>

<p>I was worried but you and Whitney greeted us as you always did &#8211; tail stubs wagging, noses snorting and happiness on your face. We put you on a blanket in our bed and made you comfortable. As I would do for any good friend of mine.</p>

<p>On Monday I dropped you off early and the vet did the ultrasound and saw what we expected him to see. A large cancerous mass and not many options for helping you or making you feel better. Julie, Hannah and I stayed with you and just hung out for a while. Then Hannah asked hard questions and we gave her the hard answers. Sometimes life isn&#8217;t fair and we don&#8217;t always get what we want. In this case more time with you. With Hannah getting a little upset she and Julie went out of the room. I sat with you and enjoyed the way you stood over me, like you did to other dogs, mainly Whitney. Then it was time and the doctor eased you down with some Valium and you relaxed next to me. You seemed tired and I didn&#8217;t blame you. How could you not be tired with a tumor bigger than my fist growing out of your kidney? I put my hand on your heart, told you I loved you and cried. The doctor administered the final dose and I put one hand on your head and scratched your ears they way you liked. I put my hand on your heart and felt the final beat. You were gone and my heart felt broken. I know with time the loss of you gets easier to bear but the void in my heart will be there forever, next to the voids left by some other friends who have gone through the same door you did.</p>

<p>I have known since I was young that I am an animal lover. I think it was the way my emotions ran wild at the end of &#8216;Where the Red Fern Grows&#8221; &#8211; I read that book around the time Murphy the red colored golden retriever of my youth passed the same way you just did. I&#8217;m sure you will see him, Hobbes, Katie and Mr. Clyde at the big dog park in the sky &#8211; tell them I say hi.</p>

<p>When I was a child I thought death was bad because it took something I wanted from me and left me with sadness. As I have grown I have learned that death is not about me. It&#8217;s about you and what you need from me. Understanding, compassion, love &#8211; I hope that came through as I touched you. Letting go is hard to do but it wouldn&#8217;t be hard if there wasn&#8217;t so much good that happened during our short time together. It&#8217;s funny I think that the most important sense we have is touch and you were always sweetly touching me, physically when you put your head in my lap or when you did somehting funny and made us laugh. I see and hear tens to hundreds of people every day but only touch a few. A shoulder squeeze from my wife can make a bad day good in an instant. A look from a boxer that says &#8220;Let&#8217;s play!&#8221; can make any worries melt away. You gave me this insight and touched my heart in a way that only a few can.</p>

<p>So my friend, thank you for your boxerness. The exuberance and joy you brought to this world cannot be replaced. While my heart is heavy now I take comfort in the memories you freely gave to me. May you rest in peace I will see you on the other side.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah did some Fall maintenance on our pets. After doing that they went for a ride. Hannah rode by herself and learned to steer BoBo in a circle. Watch &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, a very lucky Mr. Kee Kee narrowly escaped becoming a coyote dinner. The coyote jumped the fence chasing him into the neighbors yard. I chansed the coyote away once and then went and got shoes and a flash light. I was gone less than a minute when Mr. Coyote jumped back over. I threw a river rock at him and shooed him away over the hill that sits between us and hole twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very pissed Mr Kee Kee went to the vet to get checked out. The conclusion is that he was very lucky and Julie and I have decided to enlist Hannah&amp;#8217;s help in keeping Mr. Kee Kee inside &amp;#8211; permanently. Julie did mention that she saw a few unlucky mice (bones) in the x-ray they took of Mr. Kee Kee when he was getting checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

Julie did mention that she saw a few unlucky mice (bones) in the x-ray they took of Mr. Kee Kee when he was getting checked out.</p>

<p>I wish we got the pictures of our e-rays. From personal experience I wish I had a collection of all mine. Not only would it help me keep track of</p>

<p>the injuries (pre-blogging days included) that I have sustained but I think x-ray pictures are pretty cool.</p>

<p>While I don&#8217;t feel any animosity towards the coyote &#8211; he is just doing what he needs to do to get by. It was a little upsetting to see the ease with which he jumped the fence. With the days getting shorter and Hannah&#8217;s increased independence moving around the house and the yard she could be out there when it&#8217;s dark. I think the dogs help but there are only two. For Mr. Kee Kee &#8211; I think he is going to be a pain for a while. Hell, we had brought him in at 5pm last night. He opened the screen door and went back out. I am guessing because hunting at night is more natural to him. Now he knows that there are bigger fish in this pond but I think he will still try to get out once he gets over this episode.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Excel is blah to work with. A client gives us data made with it though and they put symbols in the text. After trying to cat out the tsv file I found this solution from within emacs:
M-x replace-regexp&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; [[:nonascii:]] RET RET
It found and replaced the pesky tm symbols in the text file with nothing. I wonder if the [[:nonascii:]] char class is available on the command line in awk or sed?</description>

            <description>Hannah helped me pick out some new fish last night. Mr. Fishy died a few weeks ago when the tank had an oxygenation issue.
Since it was book club night Hannah and I had Mac n&amp;#8217; Cheese and then went to the pet store. She looked at all the fish but was more interested in the cats. She didn&amp;#8217;t want to choose I guided her into the Black Mollies and the Neon Tetras.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannah and I did some painting this afternoon. We did it out on the front porch because part of the process is making the paints, at least to start. The paint is some all natural stuff that is made from veggies and comes in powder form and gets mixed up with water. From past experience while painting with my daughter &amp;#8211; making up the paint is the least messy part of the session. But I told her that is why we were doing it outside, because it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if we are messy when we paint outside. We could just hose everything off after &amp;#8211; even her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah was a big help scooping the powder out and mixing in the water. OPnce we had the veggie paint set up we each did a few water colors and then she wanted black. Since we couldn&amp;#8217;t make black with the veggie paint Hannah finished up with the pre-mixed tube paints. When can I tell if her affinity with back is a goth tendency? Since I was not about to put paint all ovar myself to do handprints like she was I started trimming lilac shrubs. Then, when she was done I hosed Hannah, the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Her and I went for a ride out to the lake, though the park and back home form cold water and popcycles on the deck. In the embedded slideshow below there are also a few choice pics from Primrose Art class.</p>

            <description>My news consumption has changed since I began using a real smart phone circa 2007. I just seem to read more news sites on that. It might be related to the sites I get news from. They usually link to short fluff type pieces and they are easy to consume without much thought or much time invested. However, I also run into the situation where I find a meatier post &amp;#8211; something technical, something political, something educational.</description>

However, I also run into the situation where I find a meatier post &#8211; something technical, something political, something educational. These are nice reads but they take time to digest and comprehend.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like to read that kind of media on a small screen. So I email myself a link. I recently asked myself how many times I have emailed myself and the follow on questions: what is the link breakdown and body content of the messages to myself.</p>

<p>Here is a start to answer the first question:</p>

<p><code>matt@hippeelee-mbp 09/03/11 09:07:38&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>A minor rant on the inability of large companies to meet my needs. I understand that they do everything for the average customer and that really means the numbers that the MBA&amp;#8217;s and finance geeks tell them are important. There is no real person who is the average home depot customer and that means the individuals get passed over in the end. Thats fine, I understand that they have to keep the shareholdes happy.</description>

<p>I just don&#8217;t want them to pretend that &#8220;they can help&#8221; or that they &#8220;are the experts.&#8221; If, like earlier in the summer I needed something cut and you can&#8217;t cut it or like today when you can&#8217;t maintain your rental equipment (paver cutting wet saw) so that it is available when I need it ( they rental guy said it&#8217;s been over a month and there it&#8217;s not looking good for the future) then how can I trusty your advertising and your nice folks who want to help me?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I can trust Home Depot and they certainly could not help 🙁</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a rental place in Lafayette that will be able to help me.</p>

  Here are the photos from dinner. I don&#8217;t usually upload ful size files but the two images of our group outside the restaurant are (they weigh in at over 10MB) so they could be downloaded and printed. Ask me for any of the others if you want them &#8211; I can post the full size image and give you a link.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was clean up day and investigate day. I started off with getting the murano&amp;#8217;s tires rotated and then brought it back home for closer inspection of the pads and rotors. They all looked ok. there was a hard to notice groove or ridge in the driver side rear rotor but hard to notice. I&amp;#8217;m not sure whats making the sound but I did notice that the front driver side shock seems to (slowly) be leaking something or something is leaking from above it. The bottom half of the boot was trashed so I removed it and it now matches the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did some watering and planted the grasses on the west side of the deck. They are supposed to grow 3-5 feet wide and 6-8 feet tall. We shall see how they do onec the roots veture out of the topsoil I placed them in. The only thing left to complete my summer project is to buy one large wall block and 2-4 toppers. Then I can rent a saw and make the cuts so that the toppers do not have gaps in them and the ends are flush and can be used as steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a hunter walking in&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>my yard today. KeeKee walked up to the deck with a snake in his mouth. Went straight for the only (easy) way under the deck and, I assume, had a mid-afternoon snack. I believe some call it siesta or tea time. Oh yeah, look out mice in the garage stealing grass seed and putting it in annoying spaces. Mr. KeeKee is going to get some lights out there this fall.</p>

<p>Tonight, Julie and I sat and watched the garden grow while the moon rose and the sun set. I got some decent pictures of the moon and a few clouds that were passing buy during that magical time when the light reflects off the clouds in gorgeous tones of white, gray and orange. The oranges range from a deep, fiery reddish to pale flame color that looks like a candle burning out.</p>

<p>Once I got my computer back from J I looked into roses. I came across a candidate that I like. It meets the requirements I have for color and size. It is called <strong>Cardinal Hume</strong> and was bred by Harkness, UK 1984.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I just re-read what I put on the two pages bookending the &amp;#8220;Think Big&amp;#8221; two page spread in the in5 book. If I am not going to DO, why do I show up? To put it into a perspective that I have, lets talk riding. Riding anything, everything. I hope you like to ride as much as I do or at least have a passion for something that takes a mastery of your mind and your body in concert. For me thats where the soul lives. In the best rides, the lines that are the most fun are also the most challenging. Those are the sessions that force me to be &lt;em&gt;in the moment&lt;/em&gt; and I don&amp;#8217;t think. Once the trail is behind me I&amp;#8217;ll usually say to myself, &amp;#8220;Wow! That was fun.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it fun? That is the most important thing. Are the problems that you solve fun? If not, why do you wait for it to be fun &amp;#8211; make up a game for one. The volvo repair shop wants $850 to put in a new alternator and I can get it the same day. I would rather find something else to do with that money. So car repairs,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I hope you like to ride as much as I do or at least have a passion for something that takes a mastery of your mind and your body in concert. For me thats where the soul lives. In the best rides, the lines that are the most fun are also the most challenging. Those are the sessions that force me to be <em>in the moment</em> and I don&#8217;t think. Once the trail is behind me I&#8217;ll usually say to myself, &#8220;Wow! That was fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was it fun? That is the most important thing. Are the problems that you solve fun? If not, why do you wait for it to be fun &#8211; make up a game for one. The volvo repair shop wants $850 to put in a new alternator and I can get it the same day. I would rather find something else to do with that money. So car repairs,</p>

<p>mundane and a little pricey, is the game. My goal is to save a few bucks and find something fun to do. Exploring the options from diy to other quotes is now a game. Can I do better than the repair shop? It&#8217;s nothing personal against them and I understand why, for them, it is so expensive. They are locked into dealer parts or very close to that. And boy, getting an alternator for the s40 sure is not easy. In fact it&#8217;s so hard that the repair shop is having a hard time finding a re-built replacement. They said it&#8217;s to new. Huh, how is a 2005 car new?</p>

<p>Fun is not easy. Don&#8217;t believe me? Look at the intensity and seriousness 3-5 year old children put into their play. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s also dramatic, intensive &#8211; with high&#8217;s (Happy happy Joy Joy lets go faster) to low&#8217;s (hysterical breakdowns related to sharing and owwies and over-concerned parental figures). So if fun isn&#8217;t easy but we have fun when we are challenged by pushing our limits &#8211; why not make a game out if it?</p>

<p>Going above and beyond your limits can be fun but you have to find your fun and that will feed you when you get stuck and feel like you are spinning your wheels.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasses in back, next to the railing &amp;#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barberry plants &amp;#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &amp;#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&amp;#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch connector&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>lines for a more flexible watering delivery. Watering times will be every day at 8:15am and 11:55pm separate from the lawn watering schedule which is once a day during weekdays, later at night.</p>

<div>
  I also got some seeds into the garden. From the golf course side, here are the four rows:</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Spinach (Planted every six inches)
    </li>
    <li>
      Broccoli (Planted every two feet)
    </li>
    <li>
      Bibb Lettuce (Planted every six inches)
    </li>
    <li>
      Baby Bok Choy (Planted every six inches)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The only thing I am worried about is that I may have put the seeds to deep before I covered them with top soil. I also fed all the beds with a three month garden/shrub time release system that Mom and Dad left here in 2009.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I have right now is a debit card and businesses do not seem to want money that way. Wtf &#8211; right? They actually refused my money. This greatly distressed H because we waited in line to ge tthe pink cake/candy/sucker like thing and then I had to tell her no and that we had to wait for a snack.</p>

<p>More and more, it seems to me the old businesses just do not meet my expectations. In fact, I have a very long post in the works about my long, frustrating experience with AMEX. I don&#8217;t want to color this post with that nonsense and despite her disappointment H kept me on my toes and I think we had fun. I say that I think because she did alot of yelling at me and oscillated between super cold (Daddy I just want Mama) and warm (Daddy you are my friend and I like playing word rhyme games with you). Thats normal for someone who is almost four right? It gets easier when she is a teenager and I can just take her on mountain biking with me &#8211; right? Right. Anyway, even though she has been a cross between cranky but and best friend I have had fun spending time with her. Here are some of the pictures from today.</p>

<p>Last semi-random thought not at all related to this weekend. I&#8217;m putting it here for now because I dont want to forget it. I have heard several folks talk about the debt ceiling issue that just passed. Specifically I have heard several people say that this was congresses finest hour because they all went home unhappy but came together to compromise on a very important project. I find the &#8216;finest hour&#8217; spin a bit hard to swallow &#8211; if the only time our elected body can compromise is the last minute on an<del>issue</del> artificially created crisis that has the potential to destabilize the world&#8217;s economy then how can we trust them to get the ordinary, mundane but important things done? Also, can one truly claim that they do their best work when they wait until the last minute to work on the problem? I guess I want to know why they didn&#8217;t have this done a month before the deadline, it&#8217;s not like they didn&#8217;t know it was coming. Are they really that lazy or just so driven by ideology instead of practicality that they have forgotten the faces of the people they represent &#8211; even the people they represent that they disagree with. I don&#8217;t know anymore about politics. I am glad to be an independent but wish that I could get represented (I.E I want to vote for the best candidate from the primary&#8217;s through the general election no matter what <del>fraternity </del>political party they belong to.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I built this. It is a split level addition to the deck. Complete with rose garden and paved path next to the house that leads to a sitting area (or golfers private driving range?) where you can watch your garden grow as golfers play through just like on tv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got done yesterday (The hottest day of the year) I sat, watched and I enjoyed a cool, refreshing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after I finished the heavy manual parts, we took Hannah to see a U2 cover band headline one of the Erie Concerts in the park series. I really enjoy them and like it better in the new park. Hannah was fascinated with the band, Once the Chik Fil A cow got out of the way she got her rock and roll dance on. It was fun &amp;#8211; I swung her around, showed her the hop and she carried the Irish flag around for a while. Although I think they do stuff with flag like shapes outside at school and her and Shaye seemed to want to shake the flag more than carry it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>When searching for files in a bash shell, show the file and line that was matched:
find . -name *.js -print0 | xargs -0 grep -n -H set_up_uploadify
This could be rolled into a custom script with file type and arg1 and pattern as arg2.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Thats what I tell myself. Everything is a double edged sword. If I can&amp;#8217;t find the good I look for the useful. Thats why I find my self ambivalent to the ie ecosystem. That is where I have been hanging out for a few weeks and I have learned a few things about what I&amp;#8217;m used to and what I prefer. So, while its a crappy platform for the web, it&amp;#8217;s also over five years old. I&amp;#8217;ll bet if I tried to understand five year old firefox bugs it would be equally frustrating. What it comes down to is that Mozilla has done a better job of keeping their users up to date with the latest and greatest and while the web has moved on, ie7 has not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, shile running down table-layout: fixed oddness in ie7 I was struck by how much more useable chrome and firebugs tools are. They just feel slow in ie7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first discovered firebug. While really useful when compared to the web developer extension, it was rough around the edges and crashed on me a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whats the difference? Why are Chrome and Firebug so much better for me now? The web&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>is always on and operating systems (until today) were shipped on cd&#8217;s and dvd&#8217;s. Also, on you are never all the way right, but if your site is down you are always wrong. So they found find ways to get closer to right. And learned from the mistakes. I don&#8217;t know about the best ways to produce software but I do know when I use software I like.</p>

<p>When it&#8217;s software I don&#8217;t like I can still practice &#8211; patience and repetition. It seems that is what it comes down to for many things. Patience and repetition. Just. Keep Going.</p>]]></content>

            <description>This morning while I was doing yard work Hannah did some work of her own. She went to the store (for real this time) and packed for camping. Now we are off to the store for some more sprinkler system parts and wood for the garden boxes.
Watching her at play is educational for me. I think my challenge as a parent is to disguise my advice (tips, tricks and my accumulated knowledge) in a way that she will accept it as her own idea.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>under the Autumn Blaze Maple tree in the backyard. Next to the hole in the ground where the house used to be, she fell asleep until Hannah came riding home on her horse, BoBo. Loping next to her were Hannah&#8217;s two fierce Boxer dogs and loyal cat KeeKee.</span>**</p>

<p>** <span style="color: #333333;">Hannah answered, &#8220;You took my house and ate my food &#8211; That makes me cranky because I don&#8217;t have a place to eat lunch or take an afternoon nap.&#8221;</span>**</p>

<p>** <span style="color: #333333;">The dragon understood and gave back the house. Then she told Hannah to climb on her back and she flew her to Marco&#8217;s Pizza at the Orchard Town Center and they both got slices of cheese pizza. The End. </span>**</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of reviewing my &amp;#8216;performace&amp;#8217; I hit the big items on my list here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/&#34; title=&#34;The Solo Week&#34;&gt;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t get to climb but everything else got the attention it needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes for the future. Staining is messy. I&amp;#8217;ll need to pressure wash the windows and deck furniture &amp;#8230; the wind blew it everywhere. The wood looks good though and i&amp;#8217;ll touch up on a cool day this fall. The Wall is built but I need one more big block and then three or four more toppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No pictures, I think I may switch to Google+ picture albums and just link to them here. A social network is not really the place for these kinds of posts but the picture manager I am using isn&amp;#8217;t as slick as the plus picture interface. Speaking of plus &amp;#8211; the coolest thing was supper easy. I got an email notification from the Erie, CO website for a police alert. It seems that 7 homes were bergled over the weekend and it was quick and easy to share that and target only the people who would be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, what I like, is a well thought out UI/UX. From looking at things that break&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the tradition of reviewing my &#8216;performace&#8217; I hit the big items on my list here: <a href="http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/" title="The Solo Week">http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/</a>. I didn&#8217;t get to climb but everything else got the attention it needed.</p>

<p>Some notes for the future. Staining is messy. I&#8217;ll need to pressure wash the windows and deck furniture &#8230; the wind blew it everywhere. The wood looks good though and i&#8217;ll touch up on a cool day this fall. The Wall is built but I need one more big block and then three or four more toppers.</p>

<p>No pictures, I think I may switch to Google+ picture albums and just link to them here. A social network is not really the place for these kinds of posts but the picture manager I am using isn&#8217;t as slick as the plus picture interface. Speaking of plus &#8211; the coolest thing was supper easy. I got an email notification from the Erie, CO website for a police alert. It seems that 7 homes were bergled over the weekend and it was quick and easy to share that and target only the people who would be interested in it.</p>

<p>More and more, what I like, is a well thought out UI/UX. From looking at things that break</p>

<p>on my car to targeting my personal message and presence on the web &#8211; make it easy for me and I will be a happy customer. Make it hard for me and i&#8217;ll just be lazy. I read an argument that was made to defend facebook because of all the attention (I&#8217;m hesitant to say press because I&#8217;m not sure the sensationalistic, soundbyte standard is really press). The gist of the defense was something like &#8220;All google did was put a nice interface on very similar services that facebook already provides. Sort of true, depending on how you classify and use the services. However, isn&#8217;t that what Apple is famous for doing? The ipod+itunes system was launched in late 2001 and I recall people saying something similar &#8211; it&#8217;s just an mp3 player with a nicer UI. We know how that turned out for both Consumers and Apple. By offering a system that substantially improved the experience of buying and managing digital media Apple got a huge number of people to join their ecosystem.</p>

<p>For me, this is where facebook goes wrong, The few times I tried to use it, the facebook ui felt unintuitive and foreign, it led me down blind ally&#8217;s, confused me with what my current state was and how my actions would change or update that state and never made it clear who could see my messages. If everything is public then why do we need facebook when we have websites and blogs?. For me, when it comes to managing a free service I realize that I am the product and that I cede some control in exchange for a free account. But if the service isn&#8217;t easy, if your policies are ever changing or conflabulated with a bunch of legal jargon that rivals eulas, i&#8217;m lazy and I&#8217;m not going to put in the work. I&#8217;ve gotten by pretty well the last 35 years &#8230; facebook hasn&#8217;t made it better or worse, just different. The first few times I tried to use it it sucked hours from my life and I was just trying to get it set up. It became more like a job to understand and manage the network. Since I am lazy and I loathe wasting my free time keeping on top of policy changes and updating my state so it&#8217;s inline with my personal opinions and preferences &#8211; I put the minimum viable information needed to represent myself and stopped wasting my free time on the site. With google&#8217;s interface, in less than a day I have already done what took me hours? days? to try and do before. But that&#8217;s just me I am coming to believe that t e&#8221;social networking wars&#8221; much like editor, programming and holy wars are really arguments about preferences. And people are full of preferences, just like they are full of phenotypes. Most genes are expressed in ranges that go from one extreme to another. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting here &#8211; google+ is a similar concept to those that came before it, in some ways its an evolution to attract the part of the range of people who want a different way to create and manage their online messages and relationships.</p>

<p>The other thing that bugs me about twitter/fb is the mareting aspect of it is really just the same. The more things change (technology enabled social media marketing efforts) the more they stay the same (large entrenched businesses pushing their version of reality instead of interacting and adapting based on the feedback from the service.) Take facebook &#8211; most large companies have set up accounts, put links on their websites and ask you to friend them or thumbs up them. Why should I do that when Big Co still can&#8217;t supply enough help to interact with me personally? Can you have a 1-to-1 discussion with a company representative on fb or twitter? So far, not so much for me. In addition, I don&#8217;t <del>believe </del>care what Big Company&#8217;s mission and values are &#8211; they will always put their interests above mine. Thats ok, big companies are all about synergy and efficiency which saves them (and me) money at the expense of personalized service. The older I get the more inclined I am to pay more for the attention to detail though. It is not free nor is good service easy.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%wppa%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=4%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about someone who decides the day before what The Most Important Thing is for the next day. Then, as part of their routine they spend an uninterrupted 90 minutes working on that Thing. Sounds like a good idea. I am a create of habit and routine &amp;#8211; I like the balance it provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah are heading up to McMinnville next week during Amgen&amp;#8217;s summer shutdown for a week off. I&amp;#8217;m not sure but I think I might be the one getting a week off 🙂 Shhhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to pseudo plan my solo week routine I have a list of the most Important Things that will need my attention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily walks or rides around with the dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ride -&amp;gt; WP&amp;#8217;s bike park is open and the new Valmont bike park needs to be scouted out for fun and to plan future trips with Hannah and perhaps Julie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb. It&amp;#8217;s much more fun than lifting weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build The Wall. I think the arc needs to go around to the fence post and then I can step down 3.5 or 4 steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Stain Pergola. Didn&amp;#8217;t get to last fall or spring &amp;#8230; &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug AMEX about the claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the Important Things are really just routines that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I read about someone who decides the day before what The Most Important Thing is for the next day. Then, as part of their routine they spend an uninterrupted 90 minutes working on that Thing. Sounds like a good idea. I am a create of habit and routine &#8211; I like the balance it provides.</p>

<p>Julie and Hannah are heading up to McMinnville next week during Amgen&#8217;s summer shutdown for a week off. I&#8217;m not sure but I think I might be the one getting a week off 🙂 Shhhhhh.</p>

<p>So to pseudo plan my solo week routine I have a list of the most Important Things that will need my attention:</p>

<ol>
<li>Daily walks or rides around with the dogs.</li>
<li>Ride -&gt; WP&#8217;s bike park is open and the new Valmont bike park needs to be scouted out for fun and to plan future trips with Hannah and perhaps Julie.</li>
<li>Climb. It&#8217;s much more fun than lifting weights.</li>
<li>Build The Wall. I think the arc needs to go around to the fence post and then I can step down 3.5 or 4 steps.</li>
<li><del>Stain Pergola. Didn&#8217;t get to last fall or spring &#8230; </del></li>
<li>Bug AMEX about the claim.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two of the Important Things are really just routines that</p>

<p>I used to have when there was more time for Me. Two others are worthwhile yard projects and Climbing is fun and good for me. That&#8217;s why I think I am the one getting the week off even though it is still a usual work week. For riding and exploring VBP it will be easy to get up early and maybe even hit it twice. The dogs will fit in nicely at either 6ish or later after Climbing. I&#8217;ll continue chipping away at the wall, I&#8217;m thinking sunday afternoon and Wednesday will be the main days with time build into Friday. Sunday morning i&#8217;ll get up to WP for a while and then head up to Fort Collins to explore that trail on Monday. The staining will happen on Saturday after I get back from the airport.</p>

<p>Mmmm Costa Rican Coffee.</p>

            <description>This past weekend, I read a blog post that talked about a data type for &amp;#8216;me.&amp;#8217; The argument premise is that blogs are nice and all but they don&amp;#8217;t capture everything. They only capture a pseudo linear timeline of my output. However the data in my output is more than just what I am thing or recording on a blog. It includes emails, social media things and stuff on my computers that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a happy home upon a cloud anywhere.</description>

<p>I think there is a lot of stuff on my home computer that is not valuable in the sort term because they are just details. But, given a proper set of tools, in aggregate this information is extremely valuable to me.</p>

<p>Given the large amount of information that I am accumulating how will I get value out of it for myself in six months or six years? How will my children&#8217;s children get value out of it in six generations?</p>

            <title>Happy Papa</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%wppa%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=3%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &amp;#8211; it has been a great Father&amp;#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &amp;#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later she asked me, &amp;#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her &amp;#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then my friends are cool.&amp;#8221; She said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we got&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Later she asked me, &#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her &#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my friends are cool.&#8221; She said.</p>

<p>Next, we got</p>

<p>some transplanting materials from the building supply store for the tomato plant and flowers. We had to go back for the cage because I forget it. Hannah observed that I can be forgetful and the we can get better at remembering things. So young to take on such a responsibility &#8230;</p>

<p>Finally we stopped at Costco for some dog food and lunch. On the way in she saw a boat parked in front and asked me if she could buy it. I took her to look at the price tag and it was about $30k.</p>

<p>I asked her, &#8220;Do you have enough money with you to buy it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said, &#8220;No, but I didn&#8217;t bring my piggy bank or else I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her that I preferred to spend my $30k on other toys. 🙂</p>

<p>We went in, got the dog food, a few samples and other things and then had a yummy cheese pizza lunch with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> sprite and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> iced tea combo drink. When we got home we found the two pill bugs we tried to save in the container; but they were not moving. I had given her a container that was airtight and forgot to tell her to keep it cracked open so the bugs can get air. I told her they were dead and it was my fault for not telling her that they needed air. She said, &#8220;No they are just sleeping and will wake up later&#8221;</p>

<p>Then we took our materials in the back yard and transplanted our flowers and the tomato plant for Julie. I watered the trees and shrubs and Hannah informed me that I take to long. I think this was related to the fact that I told her she could wash off the pots after I was done watering. I was so slow that it was causing her physical pain, I think.</p>

<p>Finally we finished up and picked up our tools and decided to go out to BoBo. We took her bike because she wanted to ride it at the barn. We brushed BoBo down and picked his feet as usual. Hannah dicided to ride so I threw on his saddle and led them out to the pasture to graze and ride. Then Hannah decided she wanted to walk around so I helped her off and she went to explore the pasture and look at flowers. Not going to let a perfectly good saddle go to waste I hopped onto BoBo and enjoyed a nice seat.</p>

<p>Tired, Hannah fell asleep before we got home even though she knew we were heading out to the pool. She is sleeping as I write this. After she wakes up we will grab our pool things, pack up some PB&amp;J sandwiches and other snacks for dinner and head over to the pool at the fitness center. She doesn&#8217;t know it but she will treat me to some frozen yogurt after pool time.</p>

<p>Despite my favorite person being so far away Father&#8217;s Day has made me happy.</p>]]></content>

<p>Hannah is not quite reading the Dr. Seuss book, &#8220;Hop On Pop.&#8221; Despite the drama that seems to have become part of the night night routine, I really like reading books with her. She has me point to the words and read them and then she copies me. She gets impatient when there are more than one sentence and uses the pictures as context and reads ahead.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an odd juxtaposition of her partial knowledge of words and reading and her ability to use context to figure out the words on the page. I know I used to do this alot when I read books with words or ideas that I am not familiar with. The incremental way we learn new things seems to repeat no matter what level you are on.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;How can I create an interface if everyone is different &amp;#8211; does things in different ways, prefers their favorite flavors which are different from mine &amp;#8230; has a different emotional reaction than I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously this seems to have been handled with convention and the law of mass average, The law of mass average is my understanding that if you put a jar full of jellybeans out and ask people to guess the number almost everyone will be wrong. If you average the guesses from everyone you will be very close to the correct answer. This is what convention is. Everyone gets together when they use the same service and interacts with it differently. They buy the same product and react to it on different levels and then give feedback to the provider. It&amp;#8217;s minimal, but even no feedback is feedback for the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m starting The Dark Tower again. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how many times, but I&amp;#8217;ve read the first four books more then ten times now, a bit less for the last three though. I first line is epic in scale: (&amp;#8220;The man in black fled west and the gunslinger followed&amp;#8221;). -Note I need to verify the accuracy of my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I</p>

<p>picked up a copy about the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers &#8211; Wow! This is a crazy crazy world. Why is there a link between profoundly creative people and the self destructive patterns many of the most influential artists exhibit? Is the balance between creativity and the behaviors that drive it like a wave that you ride, balancing on top until it crests out &#8211; if your still going when the water recedes you swim back out and try again? Is just showing up enough, or, do you have to kill it every time?</p>

<p>I think this little guy has some questions for us. He kind of looks like a little Ewok hanging from a tree.<figure id="attachment_2310" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first Internet access in almost a week. Pura Vida seems to be local slang for &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s all good&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no worries.&amp;#8221; For sure that can describe the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monteverde was lush &amp;#8211; the biodiversity is amazing. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to re-read EO Wilsons book &amp;#8220;The Diversity of Life&amp;#8221; again because it was about places like this. We spent a day in the national park and our guide was very knowledgable of the flora and fauna. She especially liked birds. Besides the forest I saw signs of mountain biking in the area and would be very excited to come back and ride here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a too short stay in our almost private resort we drove down the coast to Manuel Antonio and went diving yesterday. Despite the murky visibility we saw a lot ot wildlife. Today the plan is to hike the national park here and end up at the beach. Hannah has gotten a lot of pool time but only a little beach time so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten some really good pictures but I can&amp;#8217;t post them yet. I&amp;#8217;m using Julies iPad to post this and besides the annoying typing corrections, it lacks the ability to post&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>pictures to that new fangled Internet thing. Apple will catch up soon and abandon the walled garden model facebook copied from aol &#8211; I&#8217;m sure of it. The full length feature is in the works and will get posted to YouTube as soon as editing on my laptop is complete.</p>

            <description>Hannah was decorating a card for Mama Rosa and we told her to sign it. I told her the letters and she wrote them. It ended up on two lines because the blue and the brown decorations were in the way 🙂Hannah&amp;rsquo;s Signiture
In other news, Colorado&amp;#8217;s weather remains predictably unpredictable. Yesterday we had warm temps in the 80&amp;#8217;s and mostly clear and sunny sky&amp;#8217;s. Today it is raining with temps in the mid thirties, cloudy and I saw snow flakes in the air and on cars this morning.</description>

            <description>Oddly, I could use more salt in my eyes right now.
I know that what doesn&amp;#8217;t kill you only makes you stronger. Really though, how strong do I need to be?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to myself. Using the bluehost site backup tools did not go as expected. One minute there were 300+ public posts the next day there were 72. Weird I thought. I am happy that I did a manual dump last month. Here are the steps I took to restore my content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the remaning blog posts with the export function from my wp-admin export page. Lucky for me the sites small and I can just export everything and still get a reasonably sized file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From my laptop:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scp last-months-database-backup.sql to my bluehost account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into bluehost command line and run the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mysqldump -u -p dbname wp_users &amp;gt; wp-users.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the command line mysql client: mysql -u -p dbname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: use dbname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: source last-months-database-backup.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: source wp-users.sql (I think there was a confilct when I did step #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the website admin import area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the wprdpress admin import function select the file created in step #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be happy I can do this for myself 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its Time to write my own script that I can run from my laptop. Here is what I&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<ol>
<li>Export the remaning blog posts with the export function from my wp-admin export page. Lucky for me the sites small and I can just export everything and still get a reasonably sized file.</li>
<li>From my laptop:</li>
<li>scp last-months-database-backup.sql to my bluehost account</li>
<li>Log into bluehost command line and run the following:</li>
<li>mysqldump -u -p dbname wp_users &gt; wp-users.sql</li>

<li>Be happy I can do this for myself 🙂</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy Friday!</p>

<p>I think its Time to write my own script that I can run from my laptop. Here is what I</p>

<p>need it to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log into bluehost account</li>
<li>Create an archive of the web root folder and sub-directory&#8217;s</li>
<li>Dump the database into the archive</li>
<li>scp the backup file from bluehost to my laptop</li>
<li>Send myself a notification so I can add redundancy by making sure it gets onto the computer backed up with CrashPlan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Manually this can be acomplished with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>mysqldump -u -p database_name &gt; SITENAME-YYYY.MM.DD.sql</li>
<li>mv SITENAME-YYYY.MM.DD.sql /path/to/website/root</li>
<li>tar -zcvf ~/SITENAME-YYYY.MM.DD.tar.gz /path/to/website/root</li>
<li>exit (leave the webhosting server)</li>
<li>On my laptops command line &#8230;</li>
<li>scp username@host:~/SITENAME-YYYY.MM.DD.tar.gz .</li>
</ol>

<p>After all of that, I end up with a file on my local computer that I can send to the home computer to be backed up with CrashPlan or put it somewhere else that is safe.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;I have never written down my goals and usually [day]dream ideas and things I want to do when I am driving.

&lt;p&gt;In the book they say when you write your dreams down they become goals. It isn&amp;#8217;t just writing them down though the most successful people review them on an ongoing basis.

<p>-Albert Einstein</p>

<p>I have never written down my goals and usually [day]dream ideas and things I want to do when I am driving. Thats likely why I am only an average driver and make myself ignore the phone &#8211; there is only so much processing power my brain can do at one time. There are several variations to the same themes in my daydreams &#8211; snowboarding every day, solving interesting and profitable problems, migrating around the world with Julie to see and do fun things and showing Hannah the things I like to do and have found to be useful to know.</p>

<p>In the book they say when you write your dreams down they become goals. It isn&#8217;t just writing them down though the most successful people review them on an ongoing basis. Perhaps the problem to be solved is two fold; first, my brain needs something concrete to focus on and second, in order to make progress towards my dreams (which are hazy and and ill defined patterns in my stream of thought) the dream needs to be refined as I understand it better, as I know myself better.</p>

<p>Here are some of my recent</p>

<p>[day]dreams:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have multiple places to live: in mountains, near large bodies of water and close to family.</li>
<li>Create a profitable business that supports us and is run asynchronously.</li>
<li>Hike the Pacific Crest Trail, start to finish.</li>
<li>Fly Julie to the Mediterranean Sea for a romantic dinner on the beach under a full moon.</li>
<li>Sitting and watching the sun and moon rise and set.</li>
<li>Heli-snowboarding in Alaska.</li>
</ul>

<p>Achieving these dreams means having balance. As a Libran, I have a great appreciation for balance: I have experienced it in math, biology, <a href="http://hippeelee.com/blog/category/riding/">riding</a>, parenting, marriage. I&#8217;m not sure I understand it yet but I&#8217;m still learning.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m running out of things to distract Hannah with. She seems to be feeling better but it&amp;#8217;s only been 3.5 hours since she last spiked a temp of ~103. In an effort to create something for her to do and give myself some more time to play with css for today I resorted to the computer. I have heard enought dora and diego the past three days so I need to be creative in how I present things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/04/early-photoshop/images/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-1905&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1905&#34; title=&#34;PBS Logo&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/images1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;226&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-far-today-8230&#34;&gt;So far today &amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She watched the entire pbs kids am lineup, did playdoh and stamps coloring by herself. She got all the basket toys out and got into an argument with Kee the cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get a few more minutes and avoid anything Dora or Diego, I showed her how to use the track pad and made her click through all my links. More css rules are needed. I also want to take some more of the rules out of JavaScript and put it into the stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that failed to keep her interested (&amp;#8220;Papa I want to play games on your computer,&amp;#8221; she says to me 🙂 )Enter the old office computer and photoshop. Hannah can use the &amp;#8216;computer pen&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>In an effort to get a few more minutes and avoid anything Dora or Diego, I showed her how to use the track pad and made her click through all my links. More css rules are needed. I also want to take some more of the rules out of JavaScript and put it into the stylesheet.</p>

<p>When that failed to keep her interested (&#8220;Papa I want to play games on your computer,&#8221; she says to me 🙂 )Enter the old office computer and photoshop. Hannah can use the &#8216;computer pen&#8217;</p>

<p>to draw on and showed her how to paint and erase with colors. She asked where all the colors come from and I told her it&#8217;s like the new eco-paints with out the paper and water and the computer makes its own colors.</p>

<p>This three week virus really needs to go though.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The next part asks me to think about and determine my mission statement. Because of how I read I shortened it to mission and substitute focus in several places where that made more sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few inspirational quotes from famous and successful people and the book offers a few suggestions fo refining your own mission. For me that means I need to keep it short and concise &amp;#8211; focused. But I started out pretty verbose, rambling almost as a wrote a few paragraphs about all of my grandiose ideas over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote, my mind wandered and focused on the people who are most important to me. This automatically associated my grand ideas with them and I ended up with lots of details. I deleted the details but retained the association of important people in my life with important things to do with and for them. As I re-worked the text it expanded and contracted and gave clues to the direction I want to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is my mission? I like to be creative. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if I am finding a fun line down the slope or trying to find an easier way to get&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>I walked far today. Well, not really far but farther than I usually do. I usually prefer to ride things. Standing is easy, walking is not hard but its harder than standing.
We took the dogs to a creek and Hannah rode in the stroller. I hope she feels better soon.
For my afternoon walk I stayed close in the neighborhood and walked around there for a few hours on a home improvement project.</description>

<p>For my afternoon walk I stayed close in the neighborhood and walked around there for a few hours on a home improvement project. The home is looking improved I would have to say. And, I can enjoy taking a load off my tired feet &#8211; they earned it today.</p>

<p>The plan for tomorrow is to only stand. There might be a mile or two of hiking involved but after that just stand up and go down the slope. With the warm weather I wonder if there will be any spring corn in the alphabet chutes.</p>

            <description>I was able to figure out how to hook emacs up to an ipad at work today. It&amp;#8217;s still pretty simple stuff, load the webpage I am working on and pop alerts. But still, if I can figure out how to debug the errors and get the command to send JavaScript to the device working &amp;#8230; this could be a huge timesaver for debugging mobile applications.
I&amp;#8217;m tagging this as a milestone only because it involves emacs, node.</description>

            <description>I found fun turns today, the picture is below.Between a rock and some pow turns
My turns are funny &amp;#8211; the radius gets biger the faster I go.
It&amp;#8217;s only saturday and I also finished the other mini project I started last night!!! I am very excited to hook up emacs, swank-js and node.js. Still not sure what I am doing but it is pretty cool to be able to proxy a site and develop it in a repl environment.</description>

            <description>Netflix is great. I want them to handle all my media needs.
I tried to watch an episode of Merlin the other day and it didn&amp;#8217;t work. The internets said that Netflix was having issues. Then, a few days later they contact me, acknowledge the issues with an apology and try to make it right.
That transparency makes me happy.</description>

            <description>I am very impressed with the start-up time and I think it&amp;#8217;s because of the ssd. These things rip fast. When I was young I read about computers and robots. In the books, they, for the most part &amp;#8211; runaway sub processes like Hal and friends, did what they were told .Fast! Now, I say go to sleep and its asleep before I finish closing the lid if I do it gently.</description>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>Hannah recent phrase is _<strong>_</strong>_ A Doodle. Where I can put just about anything in there and she will laugh. She has fun trying out different words to. Names seem to be a common choice for her. Right now she is prone to over dramatizing before key events in the day. Bedtime is the the most intense and emotions run high during this time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to focus on the problem and solve it with JavaScript.</p>

            <description>I count seconds with the unofficial &amp;#8216;one thousand&amp;#8217; standard for timing things. When I say one thousand for a single digit number its roughly equal to a second. I say one thousand a bit faster for anything higher than ten because there are more syllables. The term roughly accurate comes to mind but isn&amp;#8217;t quite right.
Either way the fact that I only counted to fifteen and my new mbp went from off to login screen means that it starts up pretty fast.</description>

    The book starts off with a great line:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DECIDE WHATS NEXT IN YOUR LIFE AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO GET IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if strategize is a word but the idea is both powerful and subtle. We always tell each other our greatest wants, if only. Most of my if only&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t require huge amounts of money. More than money they require time and flexibility. Ask a meterologist to predict the next snow storm he can&amp;#8217;t do it, not with high accuracy. He can run the models, know the climate and the different types of weather patterns; but they are wrong more often that they are right because weather is random, truly unpredictable. The storms never hit exactly when they are supposed to, they never have as much or as little as they are supposed to. As in Life. So if i can&amp;#8217;t predict whats next and life is random, how do I get my &amp;#8216;If only&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s convenient for me?&amp;#8217;

So if i can&#8217;t predict whats next and life is random, how do I get my &#8216;If only&#8217;s when it&#8217;s convenient for me?&#8217;
  </p>
  
    
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s re-arrange the pieces and see what happens &#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Identify my top values:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The things I am I like most are: my creativity, intuition, and persistence
    </li>
    <li>
      The things I am I like least are: distraction (ohh, that thing is shiney. What was I saying?), lack of mental discipline and my reliance on a stable routine
    </li>
    <li>
      The happiest person I know is Hannah. She is a very happy three year old and I almost get a second childhood just by watching her grow
    </li>
    <li>
      Two people I like and respect are my wife because she is very smart, rolls with the punches easier than most and likes similar things. My dad gets props because he showed me how to figure things out in methodical ways that went far beyond fixing rusty old cars in a Northeastern Ohio winter. He also has an appreciation for music and rhythm &#8211; I still remember listening to &#8216;That Peaceful Easy Feelin&#8217; by CCR in the Blue Blazer with him (And not one of the wimpy new blazers &#8230; one of the old full sized early eighties models)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    So who am i? I am a happily married father who loves to spend time with his family. I spend time in the outdoors with Julie, Hannah and our two Boxers and I don&#8217;t care if we are riding, sliding or walking &#8211; we are outside! I enjoy consuming various forms of new media and appreciate the old forms too. I still like to feel the pages turning between my fingers as I re-read one of the Gunslinger novels and I like re-runs of Firefly on Netflix because I don&#8217;t have to get off the couch and get the dvd&#8217;s out of thier cases. I have learned that horses are like big dogs and that boxers in pairs are a lot of fun. The Doberman breed and cats are pretty cool, but they might not always mix well (for that matter boxers and cats have their moments as well).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When it comes to computers, I like the mathematical problem solving aspect of programming. I also like the symmetry and the fractal beauty in Biology that is quantified through mathematics. The persistent factor in solving problems programetically (sp?) reminds me of my calculus and discrete maths classes; it&#8217;s weird I know, but I really liked the problems in those classes &#8211; even though I don&#8217;t remember the problems, I remember the grizzly professor who could smoke an unfiltered cigarette in three breaths and then come inside and teach understanding of higher order derivatives to our eager young minds. I think this type of understanding is what the Gunslinger refers to when he writes about &#8220;Khef.&#8221; My college calculus professor taught us that the problem at hand is just a puzzle, waiting for all of the right pieces to come together. It&#8217;s my job to use patterns to move the pieces around and check my output against the ideal answer. When I talked with him in his office hour&#8217;s it became apparent that he meant this for mathematics and Life. The lesson is lost if I do not apply the advice to programming as well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In unordered fasion, here are my top FIVE VALUES (aka things I aspire to):
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Be Happy
    </li>
    <li>
      Be Ethical
    </li>
    <li>
      Be Creative
    </li>
    <li>
      Be Curious
    </li>
    <li>
      Be Dependable
    </li>
  </ul>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I am adding a new tag so that I can organize the things I have written down in the book Julie got me for Christmas.The name of the book is &amp;#8220;Five&amp;#8221; by Dan Zadra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through it once to understand it and then again to record my details. Now it&amp;#8217;s time to publish them so I can track my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book itself is a very nicely designed concept book. Through a thoughtful layout and color scheme it presents the tools that anyone has at their disposal to answering the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Where will you be five years from today?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question and answer format is interesting; it forces the reader to focus inward for the answers. And as fond as I am of snowboarding the Vasquez Cirque by myself or gentle morning yoga sessions that focus more on the mind than the body; I do very little inward directed thought to answer questions. Most of questions can be answered with a quick web search. However, for questions like this, there is no way to Google an easy or quick answer.

I am not used to working through rambling half answers and cobbling together a cohesive and comprehensive answer that is satisfying. I want an easy answer to where I will be in five years but there is no index with that information, there is no web app that can help me. The book doesn&#8217;t give me those answers either. What it does give is questions that will help me. Questions that only I have the answers to. The hard thing is that I must be the one to make them up if they are to come to pass.<figure id="attachment_1705" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a post by someone who used to work at youtube a while back. He was talking about how most of the people he interviewed could not work on the DOM with-out jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like jQuery, it makes my job much, much easier even in the bastardized form I have to use it in. But, I liked the challenge and decided to work on the DOM with out a library, only using pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a few weeks of 2 hour nightly sessions to prototype, but I have something that runs. You can see the repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/hippeelee/ticker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I added a page called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/ticker.html&#34;&gt;ticker&lt;/a&gt;. Its a bare bones demo and still more concept than practical utility, but I am having fun fleshing it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are more elegant tools and plug-ins that do the same thing. It feels good to do it for myself, just because I can. A bit like cultivating a home garden. Sure, I am not on the scale as the professionals and sure, my solution is not ideal. But that wasn&amp;#8217;t the point &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The DOM with images was there and now I can make them do what I want. I learned a</p>

<p>bit more about JavaScript along the way and thats always fun too. I also learned that mogrify is a similar to sips on OSX. The images I uploaded were full size and were taking forever to fully load. It was kind of funny to watch partially loaded images cycle around until they were all loaded into the DOM. Anyhow, if you are on linux and need to (quickly) resize a batch of images you can man mogrify or: $ mogrify -resize 800 /path/to/img/*.JPG. I think it is part of imagemagick</p>

<p><strong style="font-style: italic;"></strong>but I am not to familiar with that library.</p>]]></content>

Take the scenic route.  It was one of those days, there was traffic on Dillon, more than I expected. It was a good thing; I got to spend more than ten minutes watching the world change as the weather front moved in over the front range.</description>

            <title>The Craftsman Guarantee</title>
            <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-02-16-the-craftsman-guarantee/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, my dad would do things around the house, maintain our cars and fix things that could be fixed. As I grew I was often involved in helping him. At first I think I just got in the way, then I was an extra set of hands and later, I was fixing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a conversation we had about his tools where I was really focused on the why Craftsman Tools. Keep in mind this was back in the eighties and I was about 8; I am not sure who the main competitors were to Craftsman but I don&amp;#8217;t recall any brands of tools from back then other than Craftsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know why he used that brand. When we went to Sears, they were way more expensive than anything else I saw. His reply was that they were better and they backed it up. There was a guarantee that I understood as follows: The tools will perform and they will not break or we will replace it. How could they do this, I wondered? He explained to me that they believed in their tools so much that they were willing to replace tools that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I remember a conversation we had about his tools where I was really focused on the why Craftsman Tools. Keep in mind this was back in the eighties and I was about 8; I am not sure who the main competitors were to Craftsman but I don&#8217;t recall any brands of tools from back then other than Craftsman.</p>

<p>I wanted to know why he used that brand. When we went to Sears, they were way more expensive than anything else I saw. His reply was that they were better and they backed it up. There was a guarantee that I understood as follows: The tools will perform and they will not break or we will replace it. How could they do this, I wondered? He explained to me that they believed in their tools so much that they were willing to replace tools that</p>

<p>did not perform. He said they could get two things out of this approach. First, they built goodwill with the customers who did have a problem tool and second, by collecting the tool that did not perform they could learn how and why it failed and use that information to make the next product better.</p>

<p>This is important to me now because I am five plus years into learning about (web) software. As a cog, I try to remain objective about software even though I have my biases. Just because I believe what I know is better does not mean that it would be better in all situations. In the past few years I have read much about competing web technologies and the developers and engineers that build software with them.</p>

<p>I have worked in large enterprises and small (kinda shady) internet companies. All I know is what I have seen.</p>

<p><strong>In the enterprise I have seen:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The creation process for static web content take weeks and months</li>
<li>The development of brittle solutions that are revisited over and over as the business evolves</li>
<li>Developers who use process to redirect and avoid simple, no-brainer web work that any professional website needs to do</li>
<li>The business substantially fall behind the curve of progress on the web</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In contrast, at the small (shady business model) company I have seen:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A small team build, scale and maintain a platform that performed</li>
<li>Co-workers who were willing to step out of their niche to solve problems that affected the business</li>
<li>Changes (both mine and others) go live in minutes instead of weeks and months</li>
<li>Problems addressed instead of added to a list</li>
</ul>

<p>So with my sample size of one, what does this mean to me?</p>

<p>I understand that there is a reason large enterprises and the companies they rely on will always be around. I also understand that because of the brittle approach that requires means there will always be opportunity for the little guy who says, &#8220;I can do this better.&#8221; I also have firmed the belief that it is neither the tools in use or the developer employing them that makes software useful, average or buggy. Both matter, if the tools aren&#8217;t easy to use then problems are harder to solve. If the developer is average or clueless then they will produce software that is average.</p>

<p>Tying this back to the conversation I had with Dad all those years ago I wonder what I can do so that the work I produce can be of such high quality that I could attach a guarantee like the Craftsman guarantee that I remember form the eighties. Is software to complicated? Did I start down this path to late in my life to reach the high level of excellence? Can I produce work and solutions for people that I am so confident in that I would back it for free should it not perform as designed?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know the answers to these questions but I am on this path and will keep putting one foot in front of the other and see where I end up.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I am amazed at how long I went with out installing js2-mode on the netbook. To make it easy, I used the emacs default kit for saner defaults. Seems to work nicely.
I haven&amp;#8217;t been back to the orc battle since Christmas. I have been coding with the ruby koans and a fun little js project I am calling ticker. The idea is to use only pure js to make elements on a page tick, like a digital clock ticks its nuimbers away.</description>

<p>I haven&#8217;t been back to the orc battle since Christmas. I have been coding with the ruby koans and a fun little js project I am calling ticker. The idea is to use only pure js to make elements on a page tick, like a digital clock ticks its nuimbers away. So I put some images into a div and the object finds them. Then it starts with a default show but also offers the user the ability to navigate the slide show if they want to.y ticker object and its hide/show methods work on the images it finds on load. The next thing to do will to write a snow_next_image function.</p>

<p>At the gym I found a good hold in the crack about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>&#8217;s of the way up. Finally got the unmarked route that was set before all the old staff left. They made a new yellow one on the right side of the crack that makes me lean back at the top.</p>

In the one picture I am getting ready to eat lunch on top of the world. The other is black snow left over after they did avalanche control. It was surprisingly fresh and bouncy after I dropped onto it.

            <description>Hannah is running a fever again. On the one hand I know her immune system is getting stronger and more prepared to fight the future. On the other hand I was looking forward to taking her skiing tomorrow While everyone else snowboards.
I hope a good night of child sleep is just the thing she needs to bounce back.
Here are some pictures of me her last weekend. We found a hill close to home and went sledding, made snow sculpture and snow angels.</description>

            <description>If I tell someone that I will call them next week, I should call them. If I don&amp;#8217;t, all I will be is the guy who can&amp;#8217;t keep his word.
Maybe that matters and maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t. If you run in to me down the road before you remember anything else about me, i&amp;#8217;ll bet you remember me as the guy who didn&amp;#8217;t call you back when I said I would.</description>

<p>It&#8217;s not just calling someone back, if I promise to do something and don&#8217;t deliver then everything I say after that is suspect until I find a way to rebuild trust.</p>

            <description>As I work through the additions I realized what bothers me about the cms. It gets in the way of my flow. I can&amp;#8217;t just do a bunch of things and then save them. I have to do one thing, wait for the blocking ajax call. I thought the point of ajax was to let the user do other stuff while the service worked in the background.
The system should be able to track where the user was and be able to quickly, )one click) get them back there.</description>

<p>You could not ride a snowboard like this. Well you could, and people do but they usually end up tired, sore and banged up at the end of the day. Finishing, is like snowboarding. You are better off if you can keep moving forward (or backward if you ride switch) and the faster you go the more balance you have. The more balance you have the less you fall.</p>

<p>Your core is key. Strong fundamentals can go a long way towards minimizing your pain along the way.</p>

            <description>Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.
Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

            <title>Early Season Loop</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Before the storms roll through and they open up the back part of Vasquez Cirque, there is a loop that will provide all the powder and trees that I want. And it is only an hour and a half from my front door. Once you get there you can relax and enjoy the ride, the loop automatically repeats until only the base case is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be comfortable on packed or powder. Moguls will be fun for you and you connect more turns than you miss. Trees are good, less people go there and the snow stays soft and the sound is muted. You are comfortable with the Cirque and the high speed (50-60 mph) run out down to the tree line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Pano Express and start down the catwalk. Take your time, everyone is going fast so they can make the traverse. We will not be going that far. Keep your eyes peeled riders left and take the turn off to Bella Fourche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are listening to something good, turn in up and head down the path. After you pass the snow fences, look for your line between the trees. Keep your eyes peeled, there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And it is only an hour and a half from my front door. Once you get there you can relax and enjoy the ride, the loop automatically repeats until only the base case is left.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to know:</p>

<p>You should be comfortable on packed or powder. Moguls will be fun for you and you connect more turns than you miss. Trees are good, less people go there and the snow stays soft and the sound is muted. You are comfortable with the Cirque and the high speed (50-60 mph) run out down to the tree line.</p>

<p>Take Pano Express and start down the catwalk. Take your time, everyone is going fast so they can make the traverse. We will not be going that far. Keep your eyes peeled riders left and take the turn off to Bella Fourche.</p>

<p>If you are listening to something good, turn in up and head down the path. After you pass the snow fences, look for your line between the trees. Keep your eyes peeled, there</p>

<p>are glades of powder that open up with beautiful turns for your line.</p>

<p>You want to generally turn left as you descend through the trees. If you keep goind south, you will either find a path through big, fun rocks and boulders or, you will dump out on the path that leads to Eagle Wind.</p>

<p>Take Eagle Wind lift and head towards Primrose. Keep you eyes peeled for a small cluster of pine trees and circle back towards them. There is soft snow and a drop off as you head back over to Lupin. Stay near the trees and keep that speed up so you can get a few more turns before the moguls.</p>

<p>Enjoy those trees and head down to Pano Express.</p>

<p>Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Repeat as needed 🙂<figure id="attachment_1628" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been attending many meetings the past year. These are my unofficial guidelines to remember, hopefully they will help you host an effective and productive meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a compelling presentation. While I am not an expert on creating great presentations here are things I would recommend: Be direct with what you want to say, three word phrases or less. Your audience can scan the slide and then focus on you and what you are saying. The same goes for graphics &amp;#8211; make them simple to understand by pretending that you are creating it for the audience reading Time or Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start into the presentation let the audience know that you are going to talk through the slides first and that you will open up/ lead discussion after you are finished talking. This will allow you to present the information you do have in bulk and then, during the discussion you can focus on the feedback your audience is giving back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During your presentation focus on a simple, clear message and use as few words as possible to convey meaningful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan. Depending on the audience, plan your presentation accordingly. If the meeting is an hour long try to condense&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This will allow you to present the information you do have in bulk and then, during the discussion you can focus on the feedback your audience is giving back to you.</p>

<p>During your presentation focus on a simple, clear message and use as few words as possible to convey meaningful information.</p>

<p>Plan. Depending on the audience, plan your presentation accordingly. If the meeting is an hour long try to condense</p>

<p>the presentation of information into less than 30 minutes so that you have time to gather feedback and summarize the direction that discussion took.</p>

<p>My perfect meeting agenda:</p>

<p>1) Intro &#8211; &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Matt. Today I am going to present 20 slides on x,y z corporation and why we should buy them. Once I have completed my slides i&#8217;ll open up the floor for discussion and feedback.</p>

<p>2) Presentation &#8211; a well rehearsed, concise presentation communicates effectively.</p>

<p>3) Discussion/Feedback &#8211; Record (or ask a friend to record) the best ideas and feedback that you hear in the discussion. Probe different points of view and don&#8217;t worry so much about reaching a consensus, rather focus on getting the group to make a decision.</p>

<p>4) Wrap-up &#8211; spend a few minutes tying everything up. We looked at reasons to buy x,y,z company today. There are concerns about the suppliers their manufacturing unit has sourced to and we need to look into that area further.</p>

<p>5) Follow-up communication: After you have summarized both your presentation (further condensing the information) and the feedback/discussion that you recorded condense it even further and make that available to the attendees.</p>

<p>This is a rough idea of what I see is wrong at many of the meetings I attend because more often than not nothing gets decided (except to have a future meeting) and multiple tangents to the meeting get followed distracting the participants from the true purpose of the meeting.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Here is my vision for the css3zen design. The theme is simple child shapes, blocks, circles, triangles and rectangles &amp;#8211; The first shapes that Hannah recognized. Since there is a child element we will keep the colors to primary (but you can use transparency if needed).
The layout will be simple, blocky and make use of whitespace. The imagry will incorporate the shapes theme and I&amp;#8217;ll use gimp to create them.</description>

<p>The css will be written with compass and I want to use as much css3 as I can. Since my goal is not to submit the design to the contest, I think it is too late for that, I will focus on the current trends in webpage design that I like:</p>

<p>Headers and footers that expand to the whole width of the browser window and centered content.</p>

            <description>It was most certainly out of the ordinary. And she wanted to go faster while yelling at me to let her do it on her own 🙂
It was almost as much work as riding the park and the pipe or carving out heelside turns that compliment the toeside. It was more fun than I have ever had on the slopes and I returned home a very proud papa.
At least equal to being hip deep in powder on a double black diamond above the treeline and more fulfilling than turning my first frontside 360.</description>

            <description>When I ran my site with WordPress there were a few things that bugged me but I didn&amp;#8217;t get to far beyond theming for it to really matter. It was easy to install, easy to configure and easy to use. And, it just worked. While I didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy all of the upgrading things I had to do, that was partly because I chose to run it on a personal server. Now that I am on their platform most of that pain has gone away.</description>

<p>I think thats why I get so frustrated with the ektron system. The two words that come to mind over and over are brittle and cumbersome. Things are easy to break and hard to do. The amount of clicking to find-and-edit or create-new is huge! Having only been in the web/programming business for a few years I am no UI expert; however, I do know an intuitive and well thought out UI when I work with one and WordPress is both, ektron is not. Perhaps thats why Ektron is used in the workplace and WordPress is used to blog for fun.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading the &amp;#8220;choose your own adventure&amp;#8221; Books as a child and they were great fun. I didn&amp;#8217;t discover computers until college and missed out on the text adventure genre. The lisp exercises that Dr. Barski is taking me through are great fun. I really like the graphviz tool he created to vizualize the game nodes. I will be able to use that in some other areas that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding that a scientific approach works well with his style of teaching. When I was in school for biology I did my best lab work when properly prepared. This entailed reading through the experiment/lab first and making sure I was familiar with all of the terms. Then, the experiment/lab was more fun to complete because I knew what to expect and the unanticipated things that came up were not roadblocks. I have been approaching the Land of Lisp book in a similar way: read the chapter first, try to understand the code he has written and look up new terms that I am not familiar with and then writing the code to get it running on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to getting GTW (Grand Theft Wumpus) working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been approaching the Land of Lisp book in a similar way: read the chapter first, try to understand the code he has written and look up new terms that I am not familiar with and then writing the code to get it running on my computer.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to getting GTW (Grand Theft Wumpus) working.</p>

<p>Oh yes,</p>

<p>one more thing. Reading through the code for GTW last night it occured to me that Lisp is weird. Weird in the way that some of the trips I took in college were weird, but fun and memorable. It&#8217;s like my brain twists as I try to understand what is going on and in twisting to facilitate understanding, the memory changes the physical part of my brain somehow. Sort of like the idea in the documentary &#8220;Between The Folds&#8221; where the smart origami guy describes how you can give a piece of paper &#8220;memory&#8221; by folding it. I&#8217;m not sure if this will make sense to anyone besides myself, unless you were someone I knew at Kent State between 95&#8242; and &#8217;99.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I was looking for something to watch on netflix tonight and came accross the following category:

Up until now I have been unaware of the &amp;#8220;Feel Good Good Talking Animal TV Shows&amp;#8221; Genre. Finding it made me smile.
I really like the Pingu animations. I like to watch them with Hannah because she really gets why it&amp;#8217;s funny. I have never seen someone focus so intently as she does.</description>

            <description>I put my bindings on the new snowboard. It&amp;#8217;s light! I think. I have big plans for the t6.
Hannah is getting smart, strategic almost. She asks set up questions anticipating what my answer will be. Then she follows up with what she really wants.</description>

            <description>Last night was Halloween. Hannah was a Ladybug, and a very cute one at that.
She was a little funny at the Halloween party. I am not sure if it is because she fell off Bobo (Totally her parental units fault), the lack of a nap or something else. At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&amp;#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her.</description>

At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her. So, we did the alphabet puzzle. I told her about objects for the letters. So she was able to figure out that the moon associated with &#8216;M&#8217; and so on. Using that, she got all of the letters/puzzle pieces in the correct place.</p>

<p>This morning was back to normal, she helped me get dressed, played with Kee the kitty and had a piece of candy after breakfast.</p>

            <description>I remember the first time I downloaded python and did something with it. I don&amp;#8217;t remember exactly what it was but I recall setting up a loop and calculating something for a long list of numbers, data collected in the lab. It was fun and got me my answer quickly and I did not have to muddle through the confusing Excel interface to find the function that would do what I wanted.</description>

<p>The next week I started working on my comp. sci. degree and got distracted by many things.</p>

<p>I now go back to python to scratch my itch. I want to work on interesting problems, i screened the prospectives and tried to choose wisely. While I like working with html, writing it like it&#8217;s 1999 is not my idea of an interesting problem to solve.</p>

<p>Obvioulsy my coding skills are not good enough to solve some of the more important problems that no one has time to work on but I can change that.</p>

<p>This is to say that I want to see how far it can go and just how much I can do. So here&#8217;s to you python, seven years after I discovered you we meet again.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today she is three. I took the day off and we went down to the Denver Children&amp;#8217;s Museum. We got there when it opened and I think we got to all of the activities, some of them twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the fire truck, of course. And then we did a bit of shopping at the grocers after we did some construction. There were crayon rubbings and tree house tunnels and we used the words and shapes magnets for a while. Even I made some fun sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had snacks and then surveyed the outside playground. Hannah could do three of the monkey bars by herself! Then we went back inside and did some more construction and attended to some animals in the vet clinic and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got home a little after one and she slept for an hour and a half. Then when she woke up she had a melt down because her peanut butter and nubutella sandwitch wasn&amp;#8217;t evenly distributed when she peeled the slices of bread apart. both the pb and nubutella ended up on one piece. I cannot describe how traumatic this i for a three year old. It must be experienced. After assesing the situation I recommended that she&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>only eat the slice with both the pb and nubutella on it. Hannah concurred saying, &#8220;you eat that one, its bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>We ended lunch with an orange sucker that was near the nubutella and plan on hitting the park, possibly with a skateboard.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I finally forced myself to figure out how to use the &amp;#8220;dired-do-query-replace-regexp&amp;#8221; command (Q) with marked files in the dired buffer. Turns out it is pretty simple and very handy for inserting google analytics tracking code into website files all at once.
Last night, after a silly and frustrating week I was so glad to sit outside with my wife and compare war stories.
Today, it&amp;#8217;s my not so new friend emacs that was there to lend a hand.</description>

            <description>Hannah told me that she pretends to be a little pink monster. She has added &amp;#8216;Scared of Monsters&amp;#8217; to the bed time stalling routine of read books, drink water, go potty, get Whitney &amp;amp; Gurgi, play songs on the guitar and talking.
Tonight we talked about playing in the pool and she was specific about differntiating girls stuff: bandaids, hello kitty and Mommy&amp;#8217;s activities from &amp;#8216;boy stuff&amp;#8217;.
One of the greatest pleasures of bing a parent is the short time between &amp;#8220;The Day&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Asleep.</description>

<p>One of the greatest pleasures of bing a parent is the short time between &#8220;The Day&#8221; and &#8220;Asleep.&#8221; it can also be an exhausting period of frustration (See the you tube video of Samual L Jackson reading <a href="http://youtu.be/E--R1n3O_m4" target="_blank">GTFTS</a>) . It&#8217;s a short period of time when all the conditions are right. Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)" target="_blank">Golden Hour</a> (also known as the magic hour) The conversations we have are priceless and I never know what direction the conversation is going to go.</p>

            <description>Wrode our bikrs to Bobo and put Hannah in the bike trailer. After we rode him up by the dump we sat.in the field and let him munch. Hannah and Julie were sitting down while Hannah tried to put her new pink helmet on julie.
She came to the conclusion: I think it&amp;#8217;s to big.
Oh girl, you are thinking now. 🙂</description>

            <description>Busy is the word of the day.
Up at six to see the balloons. A great spring morning. After brunch I pushed the mower around the yard. I think Julie is right about the backyard. I will be interested in what they propose.
We met Erica and Jeff in Denver for the rocky&amp;#8217;s game. Hannah was pretty tolerant of all the running around. We got home early and Julie was not feeling well.</description>

<p>Hannah and I played with play doh, watched the first half of Finding Nemo. She had pb&amp;j with a side of jello. Then we pushed strollers before going upstairs.</p>

<p>We brushed her teeth and read books. She is getting more proactive in her reading and taking the lead.</p>

            <description>if Mt St. Helens ever went cold enough for snow to collect it looks like a great back country bowl to ride.
I am watching NOVA and it infotms me that it erupted in 2007 but it was nore of a fizzle. then the seismic activity went quit. Cool.
it was warm today. Sunny with strong winds out of the north.</description>

            <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

<p>We read some books.</p>

<p>This morning, got out the door early and explored the trails over by 128 and 93. Good beginner and intermediate levels and a fun loop. Loops are fun because you never take the same line twice even though its the same trail.</p>

            <description>i started at the parking lot of my new job. behind the parking lot, there was a trail. i wanted to see where it came out. it exits on 119th and that means i can easily ride to work.
it was partly sunny and cool, around 60 degrees, but windy; so i rode up the the coal creek trail and took that until it ended up behind a golf course. along the way there was quite a bit of mud.</description>

<p>it was partly sunny and cool, around 60 degrees, but windy; so i rode up the the coal creek trail and took that until it ended up behind a golf course. along the way there was quite a bit of mud. the creek is running high and parts of it were overflowing the trail.</p>

<p>for more challange it will be better to drive over to highyway 93 and park there.</p>

            <description>Hannah has mentioned monsters several times. I think it is because of Monsters Inc. Her and Shaye are very interested in them now. The purity of her emotion as she runs screaming from the room is priceless.</description>

            <description>After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.
i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.
I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods.</description>

it was a sunny almost 80 degree spring day. Hannah did soccer at Primrose and then we made cup cakes while we waited for Liu&amp;#8217;s take out to arrive.

            <description>Hannah is rapidly developin her language skills. if you can say it she will repeat it. she really likes sining her songs and demands that we listen to Hannah&amp;#8217;s music when driving in the car.
she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse.</description>

<p>she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&amp;J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse. she shows very little fear at the physical unknown. this means she will jump off most things, try to climb everything and is getting faster when she runs away from me giggling.</p>

<p>she does show fear; when i scare her i think she likes it but when &#8216;bad&#8217; things happen in a cartoon she gets visably worried and asks questions about what going to happen.</p>

            <description>Anticipating the Avatar movie. i hope it lives up to the marketing.
Hannah is making cookies with MamaRosa and PapaRosa at the Macks and Santa is on his way. its her second xmas and i think she kinda gets it. Tommorow should be fun.
[[Update]]
Good story, awesome effects. The 3d was really cool but not the whole movie. Enjoyed the story and got some ideas for my own. If I can&amp;#8217;t find a decent employer this year, maybe I can write a decent story of my own.</description>

            <description>Julie took Hannah to her first theater movie: The Princess and the Frog.
Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&amp;#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&amp;#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said,</description>

<p>&#8216;Hannah, if you are good Santa may bring you your own chapstick on christmas.&#8217;</p>

<p>To which she replied, &#8216;Hannah loves Santa.&#8217; She had a very pouty look on her face when she said it.</p>

<p>Then she rode Bobo with me and we chased Julie around the arena.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Mama Rosa and Papa Rosa will get her from Ohio and we will leave for Uncle Rob and Aunt Katie&#8217;s house in Montana.</p>

            <description>I tricked Hannah into going to her room friday night. She started out in my bed with mama and then i took her into her crib when i went to bed. It helped to hold her on my shoulder until she was uncomfortable and wanted to go to sleep. Then i asked her if she wanted to lie down in her crib. She said yes and was snuggling down, back to sleep in a few minutes.</description>

            <description>Hannah is helping me to sell the double stroller we got for when she and Mason were hanging out during the week days &amp;#8230;
Oh, things she has been up to:
 singing an almost complete version of the abc&amp;#8217;s putting shoes on missing her mama in the morning completing full sentences that convey her understanding of more abstract concepts: Papa is Matthew, Mama is work. chasing Whitney around.</description>

            <description>Since setting up at the new shop I have seen several issues with the legacy codebase that I am working with.
The biggest thing that throws emacs off is the inconsistency&amp;#8217;s that tabs cause in various parts of the code. some places have no tabs others are all tabs for indentation. Since I don&amp;#8217;t really care one way or the other I finally googled &amp;#8216;emacs + tabs&amp;#8216; and learned about tabify/untabify.</description>

This looks prommising since I can easily go one way or the other depending on what is in the region I need to work with.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As much trouble it is, i don&amp;#8217;t mind tonight because you are sleeping on my lap and i get some num num snuggles with you, like we used to have when you were really small and i put you to sleep.</description>

<p>Some play in the back yard. After some sprinkles, it turned into a pretty nice evening.</p>

<p>Today, Julie motivated me to get the bike trailer out and we took Hannah and the dogs on Ride around Vista Ridge. We stopped at the clubhouse and had a late breakfast. There are a few more things to do today but it should be pretty mellow.</p>

            <description>Hannah is a great sleeper. Tonight she slept through a lightning, thunder and then hail storm.
The storm was a slow rolling system moving in the north east direction. Humidity was 55-60 % but it was hot, around 75-80 degrees.</description>

            <description>We left Hannah on her own last night with Rob and Katie. It was the first time she was without Julie or myself overnight.
We went to a nice wedding and stayed there and Hannah got to stay up late and play bubbles, jumping and storytime with her aunt and uncle.</description>

            <description>We stopped at the outlets on our way home from the lilac circle Breckenridge weekend. Hannah was sound asleep when we got out of the car. I carried her into the first store and she heard the music, opened her eyes and started bobbing her head to the music for a minute. Then she closed her eyes and snuggled back down into my shoulder, fast asleep.</description>

            <description>Great end to my day.
I ran throughy the nite time books with Hannah. Her two favorites are the Elmo alphabet book and the color and shapes farm animals book.
Then we said our nite nites. Nite nite list: mama, papa, Gurgi, Whitney, Bella, Bo Bo, mama Rosa, papa Rosa, grandma Cheryle, grandpa Paul, tease, Sierra &amp;#8230;.
Then, after I put her in her crib I did the signs for &amp;#8216;papa love Hannah.</description>

            <description>Had a gentle second ride on my mountain bike this season. They did a good job with the improvements. I haven&amp;#8217;t ridden the loop part up top so that was fun, and a bit rocky. The meadows were still very green. It&amp;#8217;s almost like being back in Ohio.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember, if you are just getting started with a mac, or any operating system, right click everything. Chances are you will get a contect menu with relevent operations for the object that you right clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I went over with Dad last Sunday (Yuuguu is the most helpful screen sharing app):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command + a =Ã‚Â select all. This applies to files in the finder when you are viewing a folder, the desktop, pictures in iPhoto and even the text in a writtne document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you hardware (scanner / printer) has an issue try unplugging it and then plugging it back in before you look at anything else. Worst case scenario, use the System Preferences/Print &amp;amp; Fax pane and uninstall/reinstall your printer software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad&amp;#8217;s intro to spotlight. After we &amp;#8216;fixed&amp;#8217; the scanner he tested it to make sure it worked but he didn&amp;#8217;t choose the right folder to save the scanned image in. Since he roughly remembered the name he used I directed him to the little magnifying glass in the top right hand corner of his screen. Dad, meet Spotlight. He typed in the name he remembered and there it was in the drop down list. I told him to click&lt;/li&gt;

<p>on it. You can also access the Spotlight search from the Finder. In fact it might be easier for a beginner to use since it will show you the path to your missing file after you click on it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Organizing files on the desktop. First minimize or use Expose to clear all windows from the screen so you can see the desktop. Then make sure focus is on the desktop by clicking anywhere on it andÃ‚Â select all files (Command + a). Now you can use the view menu to organize the files/folders on you desktop as you wish. TO get started I recommend selecting all, View/Keep Arranged By/Name to put them in alphabetical order.</li>

            <description>I miss riding my mountain bike to work. I am not talking about the crappy bike lane commute into boulder. I miss the ride from the Moorepark trailhead to Amgen in Thousand Oaks.
It took about 45 min, had showers when I got there and I usually had the trail to lonesome.
Time is a luxury that I didn&amp;#8217;t realize I had until I started to run out of it.</description>

            <description>Internet radio is so very convienient. Not having cable I can&amp;#8217;t watch the Cavs stay alive on TV. Since they don&amp;#8217;t offer me the opportunity to pay to watch on NBA.com, at least not that was easy to find, I fired up iTunes and there it is under the sports/talk internet radio section.
It reminds me of visiting my Grandpa I when I was little. He used to sit under he awning and listen to Indians games on a little portable am/fm radio while playing solitaire in the afternoon.</description>

            <description>Had a seriously good time last night with Julie at the ninja show. There was a 1&amp;frasl;4 moon setting in the western sky, an 800 fill sleeping bag to keep us warm and rock show loud enough to make the ground vibrate. Head Like A Hole always jams, hard.
This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining.</description>

<p>This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining. She did get her shoes on, but I helped a little. The hat was all her.</p>

<p>No pics really came out from last night but I got some of Hannah looking very stylish this morning.</p>

            <description>From the book JavaScript: The Good Parts is this little gem.
The lineage of an object is irrelevant. What matters about an object is what it can do, not what it is decended from.
&amp;#8230;
Prototypal Inheritance:
You start by making a useful object. You can then make many more objects that are like that one.</description>

<p>I have been meaning to find a solution for this for a while. Emacs Wiki, you guide me well. Repeating to self five times: &#8220;Command four tee&#8221;, &#8220;Command 40&#8221;, &#8220;Command 4 t&#8221;, &#8220;Command four t&#8221;, &#8220;Command 4 tee&#8221;</p>

She did great! Going to school is hard, I forgot how much so from the last time. I guess I did it to myself, I could have turned the scholarship down, but then I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have these interesting shell scripting word problems to solve. They make a pretty good puzzle.

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts that need to be written down so I don&amp;#8217;t forget them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hannah knows what work is, sort of. This morning she woke up late, 7:30. (Such a great little sleeper) And Her first words to me were &amp;#8220;Mama?&amp;#8221; I am pretty sure she was asking where was Momma. So I said, &amp;#8220;Mama&amp;#8217;s not here kiddo, she is gone already.&amp;#8221; To which she replied, &amp;#8220;work.&amp;#8221; Later she did it again when Julie was on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strange Animal signs. When Julie was going through the letter flashcards she did this cute elephant trunk simulation with her arm. I took a video of it but haven&amp;#8217;t processed the raw footage yet. I&amp;#8217;ll try to get it posted before we leave for North Carolina on vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we were on a date night last night Hannah hung out with Shaye. Apparently they spent a few minutes pointing to each other and saying their names. Hannah points at Shaye and says, &amp;#8220;Saye.&amp;#8221; (I think she is still working on some of her phonetics). Then Shaye points at Hannah and says, &amp;#8220;Hannah&amp;#8221;. Form what I heard this repeated for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning. Hannah is a little&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

<li>Cleaning. Hannah is a little</li>
</ol>

<p>clean freak. She takes her kleenexes and will wipe the counch, the floor, the walls, the dogs, me, the cabinets&#8230; etc if she sees one of cleaning. A very good helper, but she gets a little upset at the broom when it doesn&#8217;t cooperate. After Julie had cleaned the kitchen Hannah took the full sizes broom and was trying to push it around the table. It got caught on a chair (cause its 2x taller then she is) and got mad at it, started yelling about her frusterations.</p>

<p>We also go a bike trailer off Craigslist for her so we will be trying that out soon, hopefully she likes to go for rides &#8230;</p>

<p>The pic is from the previous weekend. Julies cousin was in town and they wanted to hang out on Pearl Street Mall. While they were shopping Hannah played with some rocks.</p>]]></content>

Rhythm and life are a repetitive pattern evolving with time. How am I evolving? What am I evolving into?
 &amp;#8220;Little Sister can&amp;#8217;t you find another way? No more living life behind a shadow.&amp;#8221;

            <description>Hannah wanted to read the cat book this morning. We read it twice. Her favorite part was where the little kitten pops out of the rain boot and I say, &amp;#8220;meow, meow, meow!&amp;#8221;
Then we went through the alphabet cards. She is picking up more hand gestures from school, plus she is part Itallian and Italians talk with their hands. At least my family does, you should see the holiday gatherings!</description>

<p>The picture is a beautiful contrast of human emotion although I am not sure if Hannah is really sad. Her eyes have the exasperated look in them to; as if she has stuff to do and places to be and why sit here for a picture. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think?</p>

            <description>Interesting, you can remove everyhing between bracktes (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;). It works with html and I think it handle xml but didn&amp;#8217;t test that for my homework.
sed &amp;#8216;s/&amp;lt; [^&amp;gt;]*//g&amp;#8217;
It finds the first &amp;lt; character and then deletes all text up to and including the next &amp;gt; character. Interesting.
You could rehtml stuff but it might take several different scripts. There may be better ways to rehtml stuff.</description>

            <description>I just found out that SomaFM &amp;#8211; Groove Salad is available for the iPhone and over Edge. IT&amp;#8217;s getting addicting and I amy have to pony up some cash for them if I keep usingÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â bandwidth.
I also think that Groove Salad *sounds*different at night. I was doing homework after mid-night last night and the night before and there were some really cool remixes of songs I have heard before on there.</description>

            <description>I find mysefl running ps -ef | grep WORD (usually Safari but sometimes other things) alot. The Safari 4 beta is nice but still has some issues and it keeps locking up on me when I forget and use Conkerors navigation commands. Maybe I should just force myself to spend more time in Conkeror since its more emacs friendly. Not wanting to continue typing the same thing over and over again I wrote this:</description>

            <title>Practical awk/sed For My Job</title>
            <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-04-20-practical-awksed-for-my-job/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Client gave me a list of do not call numbers that has 10 digits on a line. We only have 3, 6 and 7 digits phone scrubs. Using the 7 digit scrub I should be able to use the file the client gave us as a seven digit scrub if I just remove the last three digits from each number in the clients do not call list. The clients list has 686,930 numbers in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual approach of recording an emacs macro just bogged down the computer and there is also this weird error when I use C-u with large numbers (i gave it the prefix of 100k) and it bombed out after 25k or so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I though about it for a minute and then played around with awk and sed until I came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;awk &amp;#8216; {print $1} &amp;#8216; UT_suppress.txt | sed &amp;#8216;s/[0-9][0-9][0-9]$//&amp;#8217; &amp;gt; UT_supress_7digit.txt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done in less than a minute and I now have a file with seven digits on each line that will not send any numbers on the clients do not call list. &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;Now I am just waiting for the utility script to load that file into the database and its not nearly as fast as awk&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Yeah, so that script just locked up my browser. A slightly modified file via:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cat UT_suppress_7.txt | uniq &gt; UT_suppress_7_uniq.txt</p>

<p>only has 189k lines in it. Maybe the upload script will like that better.</p>]]></content>

            <description>When I was a child my mother and grandmother made something called pizza frit. It was really simple but really good. Fried dough rolled in sugar.
When I was in high school I would camp out in the back woods on my parents property and mom would bring us a huge bowl of pizza frit.
I recall this because Julie took me out to Lucile&amp;#8217;s for breakfast and they had pizza frit (they used a different name and powdered sugar instead of granulated but it was the same).</description>

            <description>There really is an M-x do-anything functionality built into emacs. I am building a form for a client and for some reason the select code they supplied has year options starting at 1920 and ending at 2009. SInce I highly doubt that we get many people who will choose 1920 through the site and because I don&amp;#8217;t want to annoy users who choose the most recent years I figured I would reverse the order, if I caould find M-x functionality that would let me do it fast.</description>

            <description>I have been getting better at using the regexp search functions in emacs. Today I got tired of all this typing: M-x search-forward-regexp so I bound it to this in my init file:
 (global-set-key (kbd &amp;#8220;C-c sfr&amp;#8221;) &amp;#8216;search-forward-regexp)
 Of couse I also bound the opposite:
 (global-set-key (kbd &amp;#8220;C-c sbr&amp;#8221;) &amp;#8216;search-backward-regexp)
 I know, I know, how did I get anything done when I had to type out all thise characters before.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Bella has been missing the last few days. Julie last saw her by Black Rock Elementary on Thursday. We have been letting her out during the day because she gets really crazy when she is confined to the house &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. We though she was gone because we didn&amp;#8217;t have a tag with our numbers on there but I just confirmed that she is at the BVHS (Boulder Valley Humane Society).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dilemma is if we should keep letting her out or not. I am aware of the risks but I wonder if it is crueler to keep her inside all of the time (and crazy) or let her out where she can take her chances and happily goes about her business. I know I would always opt for taking my chances but I am not a cat. Since she is a cat and she can&amp;#8217;t really tell me what she wants, other that to observe her behavior; her behavior tells me that she likes to go outside. I think we will try to find a happy medium: she can still go outside, but only when we are there in the yard. We will also be getting her a tag for her collar&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You have been fighting an infection since late last week. On Sunday you hardly wanted to play. Just cuddle with momma and take naps all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before last you woke up at midnight. You settled into the chair next to my side and we read one of your books. The encyclopedia one. Then I read to you from a book I was reading, Heart in Atlantis by Steven King. I have read it before but I like the story. In about a half an hour you were sound asleep and I tucked you in and kissed you goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight when I moved you into you own bed you fussed a little bit so I rocked you like I did when you were little. You fell asleep on my shoulder and it was the best part of my day; next to eating yummy Julie cake fresh from the oven. Then when I thought you were asleep I moved you into the crib. You weren&amp;#8217;t asleep. I got you to lay down and gently rubber your back in comfort. It&amp;#8217;s been a while but I do remember what it&amp;#8217;s like to have a fever. After a few minutes you got quite again and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;M-x load-file is my emacs lisp friend. I am playing around with fizzbuzz.el and got tired of C-x C-e after an expression of C-j inside one so I googled around and learned about load-file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;load-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `files.el&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(load-file file)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load the Lisp file named file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just what I wanted to do, run my code all at once. If I had more time I could even bind a custom keystroke in my init file and not have to type all of that text out. Now if I could only figure out why only half of the numbers are printed to the *Messages* buffer? If I run the command with C-x C-e it does the same thing the first time, but on subsequent tries it will put all of the output I am expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I figured out how to use grep from inside of emacs. I can&amp;#8217;t wait to have a change to try it out in my sandbox rather than on silly html forms.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>memory it can have and use, not sure about apache though. The issue seems to be when the page needs to read or write from the database. I wonder if 1) php is not letting go of the memory its using to access the db. If so is that something thats configured on the db or in php.ini? 2) would dtrace help me find the bug? 3) if I upgraded the server OS and php would that fix the issue.</p>

<p>In the interest of not losing an entire weekend I&#8217;ll try #3 first since I can pull most of what I want from my backup disk after the upgrade. If, after the upgrade, the errors still happen I&#8217;ll have access to dtrace and maybe that will give me a clue as to whats going on down there. I need to back up and dump my dbs first. but perhaps this weekend if I don&#8217;t get any more x-file dvd&#8217;s from netflix.</p>]]></content>

            <description>The Pink Elephant pj&amp;#8217;s are for you Amy, since you liked the footie pajamas. I am not much of a fasionista, but, little girl clothes and shoes are pretty darn cute. So much so that I would even say its fun getting Hannah dressed in the morning. More fun than dressing myself since most days I could care less what I put on. When I dress Hannah, I actually think about stuff like matching and what she would like depending on the weather.</description>

<p>The Pink Elephant pj&#8217;s are for you Amy, since you liked the footie pajamas. I am not much of a fasionista, but, little girl clothes and shoes are pretty darn cute. So much so that I would even say its fun getting Hannah dressed in the morning. More fun than dressing myself since most days I could care less what I put on. When I dress Hannah, I actually think about stuff like matching and what she would like depending on the weather. Like today, its supposed to be in the sunny and temps in the mid to upper 60&#8217;s. So I dressed her in a long sleeve shirt, jeans and her active shoes. I pulled off the shell from her fleece and left it for her to wear outside when they play outside. I never would have thought that I would think or care about stuff like that. But I do, and its fun.</p>

&lt;p&gt;There are birds chirping and I hear some muted &amp;#8220;whoo hoo&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; in the trees. There are 2-4 foot drifts in the trees and some thigh high drifts up on top of Vasquez Cirque. Yummy! The next run is Certainty and the ridge that gets the most snow, at least that&amp;#8217;s what I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly did. I opted out of dropping off the cornice that forms on the left side of the run for the grove of trees and really big rocks on the right. Up top the un-tracked powder was thigh high at least. When the slope is that steep the turns are so smooth and easy it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like turning on a snowboard. Once I got below the trees to where the rocks form a narrow gully, about ten feet wide I stopped to pick my line. Between the two largest rocks there is a nice channel that drops left, back into the Certainty slope and I had a very fast run out in the powder field below where I got some more beautiful turns. Then, below the next ridge, down underneath the tree line it was good, really good. Its a lot of work to get over there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>but so worth it. I wish they either had a tow rope up top or a quick double chair that started mid valley and went back up to the top of the ridge. Oh well at least the hike keeps the slopes pretty clear for me.</p>

<p>I did some other runs down eagle wind and the main lift that services winter park. When there is that much snow (@ least 16&#8243; everywhere and up to my ribcage on top of VC) it&#8217;s easy to have a few nice mogul sessions.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Hannah learned to rinse herself off tonight. All on her own she started filling up the rinse cup and pouring it over herself. She only swallowed a few mouthfuls.
Other things of note: She is starting to connect two words together, like &amp;#8220;Hannah milk&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;up please&amp;#8221;. Also, her repetition is getting stronger. When I was home with her on Tuesday we went through the books and flash cards several times.</description>

When I was home with her on Tuesday we went through the books and flash cards several times. I said the words for new items like wagon and she was able to repeat it. It prolly helps that she really likes to pull and be pulled in the wagon we got for her. Her phonetics are a little funny sounding to me, she seems to draw out the syllables and is definitely exploring how to make the sounds with her mouth. It&#8217;s great fun to spend time with her. From what I can remember of my own and what I am observing with Hannah now, childhood is a magical time.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice day, good weather. I got two nice drops into Vasquez Cirque. It was a little bumpy but there were still some calf/knee high patches and some decent turns leading into them. I need to think about dropping in less, unless I plan on going down one of the rocky chutes, I noticed that my turns feel more natural when I am reacting to the conditions of THIS turn rather than thinking about the next turn or the last turn or the really big rock that is coming up fast.Ã‚Â VisualizationÃ‚Â is still good at the top, it gives me a game plan but plans don&amp;#8217;t always turn out as you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got two runs down the baby park, popped some nice mellow airs on the baby five footers and the little rails and boxes are always fun. The biggest surprise was the carving and turns on my way back to winter park parking lot. I leaned into some gorgous s-turns and got really good extension both toe side and heel side. There was a bit of corn on the way down too, spring is fast approaching (the last week of weather aside). The last three weekends should be great for&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;So the late winter snowstorm threw a monkey wrench into my plans. Cheryle and Paul&amp;#8217;s flight was canceled so I get to swap snowboarding for Hannah duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far today we have had our morning coffee and milk, opened and closed the blinds over fifty times and played 52 card pickup with the flash cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What amazed me though is that Hannah decided it was elmo time and she didn&amp;#8217;t want to read the books. She went over the the tv (which i forgot to re -child lock) and opened the door to the DVD player where her elmo DVD&amp;#8217;s are, picked up Sesame Street &amp;#8211; Count With Me DVD and tried to put it into the player. All this just from watching me and Julie put dvds in to play. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll trade snowboarding for Hannah time anyday because riding is always there, but I can never have enough Hannah time. And she will only be little once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for later today are to go to REI and exchange my hat, visit Julie in Longmont for lunch, look for a split board at the store Julie said is going out of business, naps and shoveling the driveway so it doesn&amp;#8217;t turn into a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>We went to Costco tonight to pick up a few things. While I was waiting for the guy to check on the camera model I wanted, I entertained Hannah with the piano. I mostly played keys and a few cords. Hannah banged on a few keys too but she was mostly interested in the buttons and knobs.
Then we started naming things. There was a display of iPods and Hannah astutely pointed out the apple logo that was just at her height and about twice as big as her head.</description>

<p>We went to Costco tonight to pick up a few things. While I was waiting for the guy to check on the camera model I wanted, I entertained Hannah with the piano. I mostly played keys and a few cords. Hannah banged on a few keys too but she was mostly interested in the buttons and knobs.</p>

<p>Then we started naming things. There was a display of iPods and Hannah astutely pointed out the apple logo that was just at her height and about twice as big as her head.</p>

<p>She pointed and said, &#8216;apple.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very good,&#8217; I said, &#8216;apple.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then she promptly went over and tried to take a bite out of it.</p>

<p>It was too much when she she turned around with a puzzled expression on her face and pointed to her nose (that got squashed against the display).</p>

<p>&#8216;Nose!&#8217; She said. It still comes out sounding like, &#8216;noooo.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nose,&#8217; I said cracking a grin. &#8216;You can&#8217;t eat that silly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nooooo!&#8217; she exclaimed and ran over to see the tv that was taller then her.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;During lunch I came across a reference to the fizzbuzz question (ie for the integers between 1-100 &amp;#8230; print fizz if the number is divisble by 3, buzz if divisible by 5 and fizzbuzz if divisible by both) in reading someone&amp;#8217;s blog. I have always said to myself, I need to see how long it will take me to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javascript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;var fizzbuzz = function(){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;Matthews Fizzbuzz&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//an array to hold my numbers and numses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var nums = new Array();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for (x = 1; x &amp;lt; 101; ++x){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nums.push(x);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for (z=0; z &amp;lt; nums.length; ++z){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if(nums[z] % 3 == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; nums[z] % 5 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;fizzbuzz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}else if(nums[z] % 3 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;fizz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}else if(nums[z] % 5 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;buzz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;else{&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(nums[z] + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var start = new Date();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;start = start.getTime(); Ã‚Â // returns millisecs since epoch which is what I want since this operation takes less than a second&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;start += parseInt( start );&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fizzbuzz();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var end = new Date();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;end = end.getTime();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;end += parseInt( end );&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;This took &amp;#8221; + (end &amp;#8211; start) + &amp;#8221; milliseconds to run&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes: it took me about five minutes give or take and I have seen it report between 2-4 milliseconds to run. The current program is 33 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emacs Lisp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

</blockquote>

<p>Notes: this took me a bit longer since I am used to stealing my emacs lisp code from google. I had to go in and read the emacs-lisp-intro info doc included with emacs to figure out how to run the while if and multiple conditionals for the divisible by five and 3 check. I still need to put a timer on it but I can steal that code (stolen from someone elses .emacs file) from my .emacs file which times emacs when I start it up. I borrowed the timer code from .emacs and i think its output is wrong: Fizzbuzz ran in 186ms. The current program is 21 lines of code with blank lines and comments, cool!</p>

<p><strong>bash</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>#!/bin/bash</p>

<p>echo &#8220;=========================Starting Fizzbuzz: $before=========================&#8221;</p>

<p>num=1</p>

<p>while [ $num -lt 101 ]; do</p>

<p>#if % 3&amp;&amp;5 print fizzbuzz</p>

<p>if [ $(( $num % 5 )) -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp; [ $(( $num % 3 )) -eq 0 ] ; then</p>

<p>echo &#8220;fizzbuzz&#8221;</p>

<p>elif [ $(( $num % 5 )) -eq 0 ] ; then</p>

<p>echo &#8220;buzz&#8221;</p>

<p>elif [ $(( $num %3 )) -eq 0 ] ; then</p>

<p>echo fizz</p>

<p>else</p>

<p>echo $num</p>

<p>fi</p>

<p>let num=num+1</p>

<p>echo &#8220;Time elapsed: $elapsed&#8221;</p>

<p>echo &#8220;=========================End Fizzbuzz: $after=========================&#8221;</p>

<p>exit 0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: This was pretty straight forward as I could use the javascript logic flow and just substitute the bash syntax. The time does&#8217;t work very well since it only resolves to seconds and I think this goes faster than that. I would need to find a way to get microseconds and I didn&#8217;t see anything like that in the data man page. Lines of code: 26 total, no comments.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I need to remember the other ways to run my elisp code. It will help to be able to do it inline when I want the resutls put into the documet I am editing, it will also help to be able to run a function from where my point currently is when I am figuring out somthing. To that end here are three ways to run elisp code:
 C-j: will spit the result into the *scratch* buffer when testing scratch code there M-C-x: will echo the result into the mini buffer when the point is in the function C-xC-e: will echo the result into the mini buffer when point is just after the last )  These commands also work for atoms: expressions not in parens such as numbers, strings, characters and symbols.</description>

            <description>Well Spring arrived in a big way this weekend with clear blue skys and temps in the mid 70&amp;#8217;s. Yesterday, e got the lawn ready by power raking it and top seeding. Hannah helped us by bonking her head three times and falling off the patio once, right on her face.
What else did we do, On Saturday we went to the REI grand opening at the Orchard Town Center Mall but did not stand in line for the free gift cards.</description>

<p>What else did we do, On Saturday we went to the REI grand opening at the Orchard Town Center Mall but did not stand in line for the free gift cards. We got water bottles though. They should come in handy since Julie got rid of all the &#8216;bad&#8217; water bottles we had which contained BPA&#8217;s. We also go out to BoBo who was looking pretty good with his newly trimmed hooves.</p>

<p>Saturday night I went with Cory to the Wildgrass Poker tournament and finally placed (7th). It was fun, those guys run a really laid back tournament and I like the atmoshphere.</p>

<p>These pictures of of the Pear Tree in our yard which is starting to bloom. I&#8217;ll try to take some more pictures of the flowers as they develop. Hopefully they will not be killed with the cold weather that moved in to the region this week.</p>

            <description>That is the main point of this post. I think it also applies to other things besides coding, things I am more familiar with like snowboarding, mountain biking and other real world activities.
When snowboarding if you want to go fast Turn less and just go straight. Depending on your skill level you may want to waer a helmet and try this when no one is around. The same for mountian biking, just brake less but at strategic times.</description>

            <description>While we were playing this morning Hannah wanted to wear my sunglasses. I told her she looked like a little spy.
I think she is like her pappa in that she doesn&amp;#8217;t like changes. They upset her internal balance mechanisms. When mamma and pappa go to work, it&amp;#8217;s a big change in her enviornment so it has been really traumatic for her since Kat started to watch her instead of Marie.</description>

When mamma and pappa go to work, it&#8217;s a big change in her enviornment so it has been really traumatic for her since Kat started to watch her instead of Marie. It breaks my heart to drive away and see her standing at the front door looking out at me and reaching out. If I didn&#8217;t know that she was happily playing and busy with her activities five minutes later I don&#8217;t think I would get any work done.</p>

            <description>Hannah strongly did not want me to get her dressed or brush her teeth this morning. She had to do it herself.
She also wanted Mammas muffin but could not have it. When she started complaining mamma used a bit if sarcasm in her voice when she told Hannah how mean we are. Do todlers understand sarcasm? Or did she just know that we were talking about her?</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Dad called last night because his Time Machine was not backing up. So tonight we had another mac session. Here is what we went covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time Machine: To check the status of time machine you can open &amp;#8216;System Preferences&amp;#8217; and click on Time Machine in the &amp;#8216;System&amp;#8217; row, second row from the bottom. Or, if you have the circular arrow with either the clock or the ! in it in the top bar of the screen you can just click that. Then I showed him how to make sure his Time Machine hard drive was mounted on his file system and if not, how to connect to it. Pretty easy,, we started a back up going and moved onto other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad wanted the pictures from the Cool Hannah Pics web page the we keep with mobile me. He had figured out how to download them one at a time by going to each picture, clicking the download link and then, after it downloaded, in the downloads window he would click the magnifying glass to &amp;#8216;Open in Finder.&amp;#8217; Then from finder he could drag it into iPhoto. &amp;#8220;Very good!&amp;#8221; I was proud of him and congratulated him for his investigative efforts. Then I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dad called last night because his Time Machine was not backing up. So tonight we had another mac session. Here is what we went covered:</p>

<ol>
<li>Time Machine: To check the status of time machine you can open &#8216;System Preferences&#8217; and click on Time Machine in the &#8216;System&#8217; row, second row from the bottom. Or, if you have the circular arrow with either the clock or the ! in it in the top bar of the screen you can just click that. Then I showed him how to make sure his Time Machine hard drive was mounted on his file system and if not, how to connect to it. Pretty easy,, we started a back up going and moved onto other things.</li>
<li>Dad wanted the pictures from the Cool Hannah Pics web page the we keep with mobile me. He had figured out how to download them one at a time by going to each picture, clicking the download link and then, after it downloaded, in the downloads window he would click the magnifying glass to &#8216;Open in Finder.&#8217; Then from finder he could drag it into iPhoto. &#8220;Very good!&#8221; I was proud of him and congratulated him for his investigative efforts. Then I</li>
</ol>

<p>told him that there is an easier way. we copied the link to the rss feed on the page and then went to iPhoto. Use the menu at the top and click: File&gt;Subscribe to Photo Feed. That gives you a text field that you can paste the link to the feed in and then his subscribe. Voila, Under Subscriptions a new entry appeared called &#8216;Recent Updates &#8230;&#8221; I think the to Cool Hanah Pics gets ct off. then I showed him how to click the little circlular arrow button nect to the subscription to update it with the latest photos. Now he will always be able to get the latest, coolest Hannah pictures in iPhoto.</p>

<ol>
<li>Then Dad said he had one more question. And he suprised me with what he showed me next! Really surprised me, I was so proud of him! he went to the apple logo in the top left of the screen and clicked on clicked Recent Items. Then he asked whats this &#8230; pointing to the Shared drives of my moms computer. I totally forgot that I hardwired her computer to the Time Machine router because it does not have a wireless card in it. He was digging around and found her shared folders where mom keeps some folders and other documents. He asked if he could drag any of that onto him computer. Of course I said, &#8220;yes, you can even drag the images directly into iPhoto.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>It was a good session. I am glad he is chipping away at it. A couple hours a day and figuring out new things for himself. Not bad for having it less than six months. I think learning to compute is kinda like working on a car &#8230; you just need some patience, perserverence and critical thinking ability to help you figure out what you want to do. Then its just a matter of trying different things until you get the results you want. Whether its finding a networked drive, figuring out how to curl xml and parse the results (what I was doing today in php land) or changing the drum brakes on my truck. Somthing My dad taught me how to do when I was a child. I don&#8217;t think he realizes it but he gave me many different &#8216;sessions&#8217; when I was little and and thats why I can do things like minor maintanence on my cars and also why I don&#8217;t mind at all when he calls up and says, &#8220;Hey Matthew, I have a question for you &#8230;.&#8221;</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been spending more time in my sandbox at work lately and each time I need to go into the seperate parts of the system to update my sandbox form the repository trunk. Now that I have set up my ssh keys and no longer need to type in a pwd twenty times there was no reason to have to run svn update blah for the four parts of our system that I look at or use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter update_svn.sh and I can just ssh into the server,Ã‚Â cd to my sandbox and run update_svn.sh and voila I get this&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>It must be getting close to spring. Riding conditions were not ideal this morning. The Cirque was crusty and icy in places. Not at all like after a fresh snowfall. I hikes it once and then did a few groomer runs but carving was hard; there were to many people to carry speed through the turns safely.
Last week I watched some of re Mammoth videos from after their monster storm last month.</description>

<p>Last week I watched some of re Mammoth videos from after their monster storm last month. I think that&#8217;s what is causing the greener grass symptoms or why I was missing lift accesible alpine slopes. I don&#8217;t know, maybe I should try to talk Julie into taking a weeks vacation out there next year?</p>

<p>I found a place that sells split boards. The package includes board, hardware and skins. I think I would like the 166cm ride but want to go talk to them first.</p>

<p>Maybe it has warmed up enough, I am going to go check out the half pipe.</p>

            <description>Oh cool! On my way home today I got an email telling me that I got one of the scholarships for the mainframe administration certification at DU. The test was hard, it touched on concepts that are hazy memories from school four years ago. I may have to go back and do a bit of review so I can touch up on those concepts.
From what i can read about the last class It looks like I&amp;#8217;ll be spending alot of time on the command line this spring.</description>

<p>From what i can read about the last class It looks like I&#8217;ll be spending alot of time on the command line this spring. The slides I found from last semester mention vi. I hope i can sed &#8216;s/vi/emacs/&#8217;.</p>

<p>The course description of the mainframe class indicates it may be a bit more c/c++ or perl/python than I have done ever. Interesting.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to it, it should be educational.</p>

            <description>Play on the giant honeycomb was the best part of the Butterfly zoo, after walking over the bridges in the rainforest.
The humidity felt really good too.</description>

            <description>Busy morning. Got tons of stuff done 🙂
Changed the oil in the Murano. I&amp;#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.
Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago.</description>

<p>Busy morning. Got tons of stuff done 🙂</p>

<p>Changed the oil in the Murano. I&#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.</p>

<p>Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago. It was a nice 5-6 footer.</p>

<p>Took the dogs for a walk this morning to get coffee from the new 7-11 that opened up by highway 7. Yum!</p>

<p>Looked into using an absolutely positioned, hidden div with a little canvas overlay animation instead a separate page for the about statement. Should not take to long to implement. Ha! With stuff to do, my little kiddo it should have it done within six months or so.</p>

<p>Now we are getting ready to take Hannah to the butterfly zoo in Broomfiled. And, later tonight I&#8217;ll be winning some shoe money at the poker games.</p>

            <description>Riding up the connector trail I had the coppery metallic taste of blood in my throat. It&amp;#8217;s an ok trail but a little to sandy for me.
I went around twice and my lungs felt better at the top. I am looking forward to riding the heil + hall trail in a few weeks when late spring hits.</description>

            <description>I took the scholarship test for the main frame admin classes at DU. Holy crap! I am a little fuzzy on the things we learned in school. I&amp;#8217;ll need to review the areas of discrete math, networking, JAVA AND C/C++ .
It might be best to start a computing sub category where I can go over each problem in more detail and address what I have forgotten</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Book&lt;/strong&gt;: Mom needs some labels printed out so we started by selecting some contacts in the address book to print and setting up some preset Avery labels by label number. The workflow is as follows: Select one or more contacts to print, then choose File &amp;gt; Print. In the print dialog that pops up choose Mailing Labels as the Style and the Layout option. Now you can specify the page (We chose Avery Standard because they are printing on normal 8.5 x 11 paper) and then the label id number: 8160. WHen he did a test print of 10 contacts on a scrap piece of paper he found out that the left margin was off so we set up a custom label that was almost like the preset. We made note of the Margins: Top, Left, Right and Bottom and the gutters (vertical and horizontal space between individual labels), the number of rows and columns. Since the preset had the incorrect left margin we chose &amp;#8220;Define Custom: as the page and put in the noted top, bottom, right and gutterÃ‚Â measurementsÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â preset.We setÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â columnsÃ‚Â at two and the rows at 5.

<p>left margin that was giving us a problem weÃ‚Â guesstimatedÃ‚Â a new distance that would work for us and tested it on ten more contacts. It worked. Now all Dad has to do is put in the rest of theirÃ‚Â rolodexÃ‚Â and he can print as many labels as he needs.Ã‚Â</p>

<p><strong>Mail.app:</strong> I forwarded him a picture Julie sent to me of Hannah in Cali. SInce we were screen sharing with Yuuguu I noticed that when heÃ‚Â receivedÃ‚Â it he had to scroll all the way down to the bottom of his inbox to find it. Enter Sorting. I showed him how to click on the Date Received column and make note of the little arrow that appears there. After clicking on the column the arrow pointing down means sort emails by DateÃ‚Â receivedÃ‚Â descending:Ã‚Â i.e.Ã‚Â put the most recent email at the top of the inbox. Clicking on the &#8216;Date Received&#8217; column Ã‚Â again flips the arrow so it points up, now the inbox is sorted by ascending order:Ã‚Â i.e.Ã‚Â the most recent emails are at the bottom of the list. I mentioned that he can also sort by From alphabetically ascending or alphabetically descending. THe last thing I showed him was how to save an attached image to iPhoto. The easiest way is to click on the quick look button and hover over the two icons at the bottom. The two arrows will make the picture go to full screen and the other icon, a squareÃ‚Â withÃ‚Â a camera in front of it will save the image to iPhoto.Ã‚Â</p>

<p><strong>Review:</strong> dad showed me how he imports his scanned photos into iPhoto. He opened the Scanned Photo&#8217;s folder, that lives on his Desktop, and selected all (command + a) the images in there. Next he dragged them to the iPhoto icon on his dock. iPhoto then bounced a few times and came up showing a message and progress bar that was importing the images. After the images were imported he closed iPhoto and right clicked on the selected images in the &#8216;Scanned Photos&#8217; folder. This brought up the context menu with the option to &#8216;Move To Trash,&#8217; which he selected. Then he right clicked on the Trash can on the right hand of the dock and chose &#8216;Empty Trash&#8217; from the context menu that popped up.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>And thats all!</p>]]></content>

            <description>Rode up at Winterpark today with Jean-Francois. He rode to, no tellys for him today.
We started off in the fresh pow of Eagle Wind until they stopped blasting the Vasquez Circque. The mile+ hike is totally worth it. I haven&amp;#8217;t been on steeps like that since the Mammoth days and this was way less tracked because of the hiking required.
On the way home, he said we had to stop in Idaho Springs and get something called a &amp;#8216;mountain pie.</description>

<p>Julie and Hannah are in Cali for a few more days; I enjoy the quiet around the house but there is also something missing.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I had Julie give me some feedback on the splash page/dashboard I have been working on. She gave good feedback that I was able to use to refine it a bit. I think she was a little afraid of hurting my feelings though but she shouldn&amp;#8217;t be, we are married after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only pushed out the layout changes and the changes to the latest post. I still need to figure out where the weather widget(s) will go and how they will behave (as tabs or as content areas that dynamically expand when the user is interested in them. I am not sure. I also need to spend some time updating the categories and making sure they are all posted in in the right category. Categories will also need to be changed a bit so that they are all capitalized. The other thing I was going to do with cats is to make several main categories like Outdoors (or Computers, Home, Cars, ) that all of the riding, hiking stuff can go under, then it will rise to the top of the top category&amp;#8217;s script when those links are generated. Maybe I write my ideas down and have my better&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a brief synopsis of what we did tonight using yuuguu to share screens and learn about basic mac functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SELECTING ALL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command + a (command is the apple key with the squiggly shape on it next to the space bar) will select all the items in the application that has focus. So if you have e folder like &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos&amp;#8217; opens via the Finder it will select all of the photos in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT MENU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control + left mouse click will bring up a context menu. This is the same as a right click from the mouse. Wen you bring up a context menu the options in the context menu are dependent on the application that has focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMBINING ACTIONS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can combine both of these actions to do things. For example, last night you wanted to delete all the pictures in the &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos.&amp;#8217; I had you select them all with [command + a] and then send them all to trash by right clicking on a selected (highlighted in blue in your case) to bring up the context menu and choocing/clicking on send to trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIGHT CLICKING:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right clicking EVERYTHING is a good way see what actions you can do. You can learn alot about&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>RIGHT CLICKING:</p>

<p>Right clicking EVERYTHING is a good way see what actions you can do. You can learn alot about</p>

<p>the way your operating system works by right clicking on anything and everything.</p>

<p>MULTI-SELECTING:</p>

<p>Multi selecting files. In last nights session we were working with picture files. We were selecting several photos and dragging them from the desktop to a folder. You also saw me select multiple photos and move them from one Finder window to a second finder window.</p>

<p>FINDER SHORT CUTS:</p>

<p>Finally we put a short cut to the Scanned Photos folder back into the Finders Navigation area under &#8216;Places&#8217;</p>

<p>DELETING IN iPhoto:</p>

<p>Deleting from iPhoto &#8211; We learned that iPhoto has its own trash can icon on the left hand side. in order to delete photos from iPhoto youhave to select one or more photos and then drag them to the iPhoto Trash can.</p>

<p>DELETING IN FINDER:</p>

<p>Deleting from Finder Windows &#8211; there are two ways we deleted from the Finder. We found some misplaced photos that you had scanned into the the wrong location. first we selected some or all of the pictures, then we used the mouse and right clicked on a highlighted picture, held the mouse button and dragged to the trash can on the Dock. Then I showed you the easy way, you selected some pictures and right clicked on them. This brought up the context menu that gave you the option to &#8216;Move to Trash&#8217;</p>

<p>EMPTYING THE TRASH:</p>

<p>Finally you right clicked on the trash can icon in the dock and used the easy way to empty the trash by choosing &#8216;Empty Trash&#8217; from the context menu that appears.</p>

<p>Ideas for matt to help him dad remember: put this in a blog post. Make some short tutorial using the Jing app and post them on your blog as well so Dad can have some links to them. I should prolly make dad his own special (sub)category so he can have one link to find all of the posts that are from our sessions &#8230; Dad&#8217;s Computer Sessions??</p>]]></content>

            <description>After I upgraded php and wordpress to 2.7 I started getting out of dynamic memory errors. Here is what I am seeing:
 Fatal error: out of dynamic memory in yy_create_buffer() in /path/to/my-blog/wp/wp-admin/post.php on line 12
 I upped my memory_limit to 256 to give it more to work with but that doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be enough. I&amp;#8217;ll have to dig around in php.ini and on wordpress.org to see if anyone else has run across this.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Trouble shooting with dad; tonight&amp;#8217;s session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with iPhoto, we went over some basic things to get started. I showed him navigating in the iPhoto app itself. We went to one of the recent items and looked at the pictures there, the photo library and an album that already existed. Then, I had him make a new photo album, multi select several photos and add them to the new album. Then we renamed the newly created album. Next we made a slide show from the photo album. We selected all the pictures in the new album &amp;#8216;chris&amp;#8217; and modifed some of the slideshow settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we moved on to trouble shooting the scanning issue. First, we made sure all images in the scanned photos folder had been imported into iPhoto, then we deleted the old scans. The HP Scan software was having trouble connecting to his scanner so I deleted the printer and re-added it using the system preferences &amp;#8211;&amp;gt; print &amp;amp; fax. This re-installed the drivers for his printer. Next, we went through the scanning procedure that he is already familiar with: start HP Scan, preview image, choose saving options and scan the photo. We both scanned and saved a photo&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>and it worked for me and then for dad.Then we quit the scanning software application, restarted and made sure it still worked. It did.</p>

<p>The only minor glitch was the yuuguu software seemed to be having some trouble, the server kept falling behind and my view of his screen kept freezing. So we restarted several times and got through the session. Too bad apples iChat screen sharing is even more buggy than that, it does not even work. It just gives an error after he accepts the invitation to start screen sharing. 🙁</p>]]></content>

            <description>Had a great day at the RMNP Bear Lake trail system. The only things missing were Julie and Hannah, but I think they might of been a little cold. This picture is of me hiking up to get some turns. Given my limited back country experience it was the first time in a long time that my heart rate was already going even before I dropped in, and, I only hiked halfway up the slope pictured in this picture.</description>

<p>Conditions were considerable for steep slopes above the tree line (like pictured here), but moderate in most other places. I dug a pit and had good results with the pressure and shear tests, plus there were several skiers who went down this slope before me as well.</p>

            <description>By Sunday morning, WInterpark had over two feet of fresh powder. I spent the morning riding Parsens bowl until that got really tracked up and the lift line got long. Then I made my way down the catwalk to Eagle Wind and rode in the trees till it closed. I found some thigh high stashes but most of it was mid calf or knee high.</description>

            <description>Hannah has been on a crazy book kick lately. In the morning she brings me four or five books to read and point out things she knows. Mainly she knows the animals. In the evening, she will do the same. Once, when I was helping Julie get dinner ready she kept bringing the Encyclopedia book to both of us and got pissed when we told her she had to wait a few minutes.</description>

<p>Hannah has been on a crazy book kick lately. In the morning she brings me four or five books to read and point out things she knows. Mainly she knows the animals. In the evening, she will do the same. Once, when I was helping Julie get dinner ready she kept bringing the Encyclopedia book to both of us and got pissed when we told her she had to wait a few minutes. It was so traumatic that she started banging her head on the floor!</p>

<p>A list of words and signs that Hannah knows:</p>

<p>Word-&gt;Hannahs version</p>

<p>Dog -&gt; dada</p>

<p>Kitty -&gt; Bella</p>

<p>Horse -&gt; BoBo</p>

<p>Papa -&gt; me</p>

<p>Mama -&gt; Julie</p>

<p>Fish -&gt; fshhh (no sign)</p>

<p>Up -&gt; up</p>

<p>Hat -&gt; attsch</p>

<p>Hello -&gt; lolo (when she uses this one she puts a phone up to her head and says it)</p>

<p>Cow -&gt; dow</p>

            <description>I stumbled on a link where that auther set up some custom abbreviations for emacs. This is just the thing to complement yasnippet mode. I set up about 11 custom abbreviations for editing forms with ARG&amp;#8217;s core custom data points. so now I can type the following and hit enter to get the desired form input:
 ae -amp email: &amp;lt;input maxlength=&#34;50&#34; name=&#34;q1&#34; type=&#34;text&#34; value=&#34;&amp;lt;V1&amp;gt;&#34; /&amp;gt;   afn -first name: &amp;lt;input maxlength=&#34;</description>

            <description>It was a pretty nice day here yesterday. The temp got up to about 60 degrees and thats unusual for this time of the year. I should have been able to leave the pups at home except for Whitney&amp;#8217;s ear. She had a wart like growth on it that needed to be removed so Julie and I performed some minor surgery. The only problem with it is that it was on her ear and head wounds tend to bleed, alot.</description>

<p>It was a pretty nice day here yesterday. The temp got up to about 60 degrees and thats unusual for this time of the year. I should have been able to leave the pups at home except for Whitney&#8217;s ear. She had a wart like growth on it that needed to be removed so Julie and I performed some minor surgery. The only problem with it is that it was on her ear and head wounds tend to bleed, alot. As I recall the Clyde and Katie incident from a few years ago, small wounds on ears are notoriously hard to clot.</p>

<p>Removing the wart was easy, keeping Whitney from shaking her head and re-opening the clot was not so easy. I ended up with the solution you see in the picture. But, after the wound had clotted several times I used New Skin instead of a gauze bandage. This way I could use the ace bandage only and just keep her ear from moving around when she shook her head. We also avoided the need to buy a cone. She wasn&#8217;t able to escape looking a little silly though.</p>

            <description>Make a home-made Mocha:
1) brew some yummy costa rican coffee
2) in coffee cup add some coffee mate + two spoonfulls of cocoa
3) pour in an equal amount of hot coffee
4) stir until cocoa substrate is all in solution
5) fill cup with the rest of your coffee
6) enjoy!
In other news I came across some very useful code for dealing with dates in php:
strtotime() is a php function that takes a wide range of text inputs and returns a unix timestamp.</description>

<p>In other news I came across some very useful code for dealing with dates in php:</p>

<p>strtotime() is a php function that takes a wide range of text inputs and returns a unix timestamp. For example I needed to take a date in the format of 2009-03-19 and check to see if its in the range of now-11 months and now+8 months. Thank you strtotime():</p>

<blockquote>
<p>//create a date range object (now-11 months to now+8 months) and check to see if users due date is in the acceptible range</p>

<p>$range[&#8216;start&#8217;] = strtotime(&#8220;-11 months&#8221;); //now &#8211; 11 months</p>

<p>$range[&#8216;end&#8217;] = strtotime(&#8220;+8 months&#8221;); //now + 8 months</p>

<p>$range[&#8216;due_date&#8217;] = strtotime($yyyy . &#8216;/&#8217; . $mm . &#8216;/&#8217; . $dd);</p>

<p>if( ($range[&#8216;start&#8217;] &lt; $range[&lsquo;due_date&rsquo;]) &amp;&amp; ($range[&lsquo;due_date&rsquo;] &lt; $range[&lsquo;end&rsquo;]) ) { debug(&ldquo;due date is within the range&rdquo;); return true; } else { $_REQUEST[&lsquo;q21845&rsquo;] = &ldquo;Due Date Note Valid&rdquo;; debug(&ldquo;due date is not within the range&rdquo;); return true; }</blockquote></p>

            <description>Well the truck made it to Mary Jane but it&amp;#8217;s cold up here, about -4 at 9:30am. Hopefully she&amp;#8217;ll start for me when she cools back down 🙂
Thoughts I had on the way up:
Blender a spindrop logo. A raindrop clear bit colored with a hint of rainbow on it&amp;#8217;s surface and slightly twisted. Around the drop there is an orange halo spinning.
The truck made it home. Had a good 3 hour session.</description>

<p>Julie and clingy (Hannah) were napping so I joined them. We finished up the day with a visit to BoBo and a horseback ride.</p>

            <description>Hannah signed &amp;#8216;horse&amp;#8217; for me the other day. The only thing is she thinks all harses are called &amp;#8216;BoBo&amp;#8217;.
Other stuff: got the lights taken down and the truck running today. It&amp;#8217;s prolly not the fuel pump. Maybe the cold start sensor? I&amp;#8217;ll need to do some more googling to see what the internets say.
Other things to do: finish the script to grep out five images from the blog images.</description>

<p>Still need to check the outlet on the front porch. Hopefully just a loose connection or a bad plug.</p>

<p>If I could change anything about our house it would have more windows in the south and west.</p>

            <description>J, RK, and L saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tonight. It was a really good movie. Very effective and subtle cg and a good story line.
I find that post Hannah some movies affect me differently. The scene where BB sits and watches his daughter in the crib was really touching; I think because I have done that with Hannah. There is nothing more magical than watching your daughter sleeping and completely at peace.</description>

            <description>I was carrying you down to Masons house this morning and you almost jumped out of my arms. You really wanted to walk in the snow.
Then, when we got there Mason was already dancing to the radio and you joined right in. I didn&amp;#8217;t even have time to get your coat off.
On my way back I took a picture of your footprints in the snow.</description>

            <description>I just accidentally moved all images out of the blog folders and then deleted them when I thought they were test data. Crap. Why did I just do that? I guess I should have created real test data for my shell script to work on. 🙁
Update: yay for upgrades and backups. When upgrading to the latest wp software I realized that I had backups of the image folders and was able to replace them from my backup directory.</description>

<p>Update: yay for upgrades and backups. When upgrading to the latest wp software I realized that I had backups of the image folders and was able to replace them from my backup directory. I think I got all of them back. THere might be a few form December missing that were not backed up yet. Ok, Back to the script I was working on last week.</p>

            <description>My tiny girl is growing bigger by the day. She is getting to big to fall asleep
In my lap at bedtime. Lately she has been tossing and turning when we sit In the rocking chair looking at the moon and stars on the ceiling.
Tonight was the first time she wouldn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep for me. I had to put her in the crib so she could get comfy. Then her breathing slowed and her eyes closed and off she went to &amp;#8216;seep seep&amp;#8217; dreamtime land.</description>

<p>In my lap at bedtime. Lately she has been tossing and turning when we sit In the rocking chair looking at the moon and stars on the ceiling.</p>

<p>Tonight was the first time she wouldn&#8217;t fall asleep for me. I had to put her in the crib so she could get comfy. Then her breathing slowed and her eyes closed and off she went to &#8216;seep seep&#8217; dreamtime land. That&#8217;s what I have been calling it. I wonder what a one year old dreams about.</p>

<p>Later when I put myself down for &#8216;seep seep&#8217; dreamtime, I found a little sock in bed and thought of the foot that goes inside it. It&#8217;s getting bigger by the day. As it gets to big to leave one kind of foot print in my mind, I find myself extremely excited to find out where her next footprint will take us.</p>

It also deleted tabs and spaces from the beginning of the line up to and including the first word it came to.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to put things out of Hannahs sight and she would turn her attention else where. Now she remembers the object and seeks it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight she was playing with the dog leashes and I put them up because she was tripping on them. Age went over to the counter top and tried to climb up to reach them. A bit later she was spilling milk all over the aerobed. I put the milk behind me off the bed and she promptly got off the bed and went over and got it from behind my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also doing these funny behaviors: cuddling &amp;#8211; she will come over and crawl into you lap if you are sitting or crawl on top of you if you are lying down. She signed cat last night when Bella joined us and wanted tonpet her. That was one of the first signs we started wit but I have not given it to her for a while. Other signs she knows include: more, drink, eat, mamma/pappa (I think she does the same for both) dog &amp;#8211; but very similar to cat it seems, up, blows kisses and she is starting to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>It was a semi lazy weekend. I did get one project completed though. Here are the fruits of my labor.
We are headed out to Utah tommorow, for turkey day 2008, at about 5am, perhaps earlier if my crazy 🙂 wife has her way. That should put us in Salt Lake City by mid-afternoon.</description>

            <description>The upstairs gets cold at night. It seems like ten degrees cooler but I haven&amp;#8217;t measures with a thermometer yet. While Julie and I were out Xmas shopping ok our date night we got ceramic room heater because you have been waking up with cold ears, nose and toes. I set it up tonight and it seems to keep your room much warmer.
I don&amp;#8217;t think that is why you don&amp;#8217;t want to sleep though.</description>

            <description>I paid for a $10 movie ticket tonight. I hope Bond is worth it.
I paid $1.99 for high test gas this week. And, it wasn&amp;#8217;t even Costco.</description>

            <description>It is almost Thanksgiving and as I start to reflect on all of the things I have to be thankful for, I cannot forget this one. Were it not for my Dad&amp;#8217;s many years of hard work and dedication to his family I would not be where I am today.
I can&amp;#8217;t say it in enough way&amp;#8217;s and sometimes the simplest way is the best, &amp;#8220;Thanks Dad, for everything!&amp;#8221; Congratulations and I hope you enjoy your retirement, you have earned it.</description>

            <description>Observing my daughters play behavior, it looks to me like the energy of a toddler is intoxicating.
She just goes and goes with an intense focused concentration. Thats prolly why she learns so much so fast.</description>

            <description>Hannah is back with Marie and Mason today. After so much 1-on-1 time with me and Julie over the last few days I&amp;#8217;ll bet it was hard for her to see Momma drop her off this morning. I hope she gets back into her routine with Mason quickly.</description>

            <description>Hannah has been running a fever all day. 🙁
It started last night and has come and gone in waves all day. To try and make you comfortable we are alternating Tylenol and Motron on a regular interval. It&amp;#8217;s hard when your kiddo is sicko.
*update* Hannah is still got a fever; it&amp;#8217;s now going on three days. It fluctuates between 101 and 104. I am still giving her the Motrin/Tylenol treatments.</description>

<p>Hannah has been running a fever all day. 🙁</p>

<p>It started last night and has come and gone in waves all day. To try and make you comfortable we are alternating Tylenol and Motron on a regular interval. It&#8217;s hard when your kiddo is sicko.</p>

<p>*update* Hannah is still got a fever; it&#8217;s now going on three days. It fluctuates between 101 and 104. I am still giving her the Motrin/Tylenol treatments. Since Julie has to work today I am going to take her to the MD and then stay home with her.</p>

<p>*Update 2* She was still running a fever this morning so I stayed home with her again. She slept from when Momma left, around 7:30 to 10:30. Hopefully she is just tired for the body battle against the virus and naps like this will replenish her batteries.</p>

<p>Post nap she had a bunch of grapes, some cheerios and JELLO. She learned to slurp the jello off the spoon and thought that was fun.</p>

&lt;p&gt;I traveled with Julie and Hannah to the Conejo Valley, she had training for work. Hannah and I hung out with Grandma Cheryle Today. I got a very good nap when Hannah took hers this afternoon, almost two hours. More of the same, I want to ride Sycamore but I have a couple of other things that I want to get done on the computer first so I may just go over there and get a quick trail run in. I have been running alot lately even though I profess to dislike it. I think that is because it is quick, out the door type exercise and convenient. I think I am going to take one of the rock climbing classes at the rec center this winter. Its been years since my harness has been used and I forget the knots and other stuff thats important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather here is really great. It was sunny and 85 today. It was overcast on Wednesday back in Erie but has cleared up even though fall weather has asserted itself in the last few days. Temperatures are only getting to the mid 50&amp;#8217;s or low 60&amp;#8217;s during the day and at night its getting below&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>**UPDATE** it turned out very well for Obama. Yay. Now he has to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. I really hope that he is better than either Bush or Clinton at working with others in the middle. The republicans lost alot of moderates so that will make things interesting for Obama and for the republican party itself. Could this be the start of a third party?</description>

<p>**UPDATE** it turned out very well for Obama. Yay. Now he has to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. I really hope that he is better than either Bush or Clinton at working with others in the middle. The republicans lost alot of moderates so that will make things interesting for Obama and for the republican party itself. Could this be the start of a third party? Could the republican party split into two different parties, one party of fiscal conservatives and social moderated and the other of religious conservatives? Since I tend to identify myself as a social moderate and a fiscal conservative I hope so. The reason I couldn&#8217;t vote for McCain is because he pandered to the extreme vote on the edge. I wonder how I would have voted had he run a campaign like in 2000? The choice would definitely been harder.</p>

<p>I cast my ballot on the pile today. We&#8217;ll see how it turns out. Google news has a cool election status at the top of the news page.</p>

            <description>**UPDATE2** boulderwindshields.com was great, they showed up early at my work location and had it filled in about ten minutes. you can still see where the chip was, barely. Hopefully it won&amp;#8217;t crack any further.
**UPDATE** boulderwindshields.com looks promising: $59.95 for the first chip. $30 better than the online quote J got. I filled out their contact form and am waiting to hear back from them.Ã‚Â
Julie found an online quote of $99 to repair a windshield chip in the Murano.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The supposedly waterproof movie camera was not so waterproof. I am in the process of either getting it repaired or reimbursed for it under the credit card warranty. I submitted the initial paperwork and need to check online to see what the status of it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also starting a camera fund so I can get a new movie/dlsr camera. I already know which model I want, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. Since it will take really good pictures and movies its the best of both worlds. One think I found with the movie camera is that I take alot of one to three minute clips that get edited together. Not being a movie, my life doesn&amp;#8217;t require &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; filming to capture the memorable moments.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for having a camera fund is two fold:Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have $1500 cash lying around and I don&amp;#8217;t want to charge this purchase &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the time the fund has enough money for the purchase the price may have come down because of new models, competition or a decent used model might be on craigslist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to put a fund tracking widget on the splash page so I can track its progress with a graph/chart. Also, I could&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I want to put a fund tracking widget on the splash page so I can track its progress with a graph/chart. Also, I could</p>

<p>put a donate to me link in case total strangers want to help me take high quality pictures of Hannah and Julie</p>]]></content>

  &lt;p&gt;
    We had a blast in Maui for vacation.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I must say that is &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;really hard&lt;/span&gt;Ã‚Â slightly more difficult than usual to travel with Hannah. It was waaay different from the last time Julie and I went though. Then, we were on our honeymoon ad this time we were bringing Hannah bear.Ã‚Â Hannah only weighs ~20lbs but we brought what seemed like 120lbs of stuff for her. Babies require a lot of stuff.Ã‚Â
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Hannah started signing &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; for anything that she wanted, food, water, milk, and her momma. The second night there, it was my turn to take her when she woke up, she was on my bed and I was trying to get her to go back to sleep for an hour or so since it was only 3:30. She was having none of it. When she heard momma turn over on her bed she stood up, leaned on me and started frantically signing &amp;#8216;more.&amp;#8217; It was very cute. She also started saying &amp;#8220;uh oh&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; as in bah, and generally became very vocal with everyone when she was not extremely tired from lack of sleep. She is also trying to climb everything like mad.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

  </p>
  
    
  <p>
    We got in a couple of snorkeling days and one day of diving with Lahaina Divers. We took a boat over to Lananai and did two morning dives. Both dives took us through some cool lava formations and caves. Lots of fishes, coral and other marine wildlife. I have some more details in my dive book.Ã‚Â While we were diving the grandparents took Hannah to the Maui Ocean Center Aquarium and from the pictures, it looks like they had a blast.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The supposedly waterproof camera was not waterproof. The first day I took it into the ocean to film Hannah in her floaty it lasted about ten minutes. I&#8217;ll need to dig up the credit cardÃ‚Â receipt, the boxÃ‚Â receiptÃ‚Â and see what I need to do to either exchange it, return it or get it fixed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We all got a few naps in the afternoon andÃ‚Â thoroughlyÃ‚Â enjoyed our visit with all four grandparents. Hannah did very well on the really, really long plane rides. I wish we could have stayed longer.Ã‚Â

            <description>You have had some trouble adjusting to time zones. I doubt that you can even comprehend the distances involved in delineating the Maui time from the Denver time zone, yet.
That&amp;#8217;s ok, you have plenty of time to figure it out. Personally, I think it is harder to adjust when traveling west several zones and by the end of the week in Hawaii you were almost adjusted, then we flew you back.</description>

<p>Now, at night, you are used to having momma and pappa in the same room, lots of quality one on one time with your parental units, and some late night snuggle time thrown in for good measure. That&#8217;s prolly how you ended up I&#8217;m my lap at 1 o&#8217;clock in the morning, looking at the stars on your ceiling and giving them names. We gave one to momma, bo the horse, Clyde the boxer, and called some others alphyomeggy, deltus and betus. By the time I named the moon: luceylunus; you were fast asleep.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>I just had fun with you falling asleep in my lap cause you are soÃ‚Â snuglyÃ‚Â and warm. 🙂</p>

<p>After googling and trying different things I found the problem. Turns out, I had two (require &#8216;slime) &#8216;s in my .emacs file. d&#8217;oh. I am not sure why that caused the problem though but things are working now and I have upgraded to sbcl version 1.0.21.</p>

            <description>Riding new trails is always fun, at least the first time. Owen and I rode the new connector trail at Heil Ranch. Not extremely steep but a good fun trail. There are some rocky parts that can be a little technical. The speed up, slow down technical to keep your balance. There were some nice fast lines on the new connector trail to. And then coming down back to the Heil Ranch parking lot was fast and bumpy.</description>

<p>It reminded me a little bit of the Hummingbird trail in Simi. A good trail that I&#8217;ll have to ride again and connect with the Hall Ranch loop. That will be a really fun ride. It would be good for hiking too, if they allowed dogs. Boulder is really weird about that. I just don&#8217;t get it I guess.</p>

            <description>That seems to be all mobile safari can do. I cannot read the news withhout it crashing several times. Does Apple have to many projects to support good quality control?
I am looking forward to the android competition in the marketplace. And will strongly consider one of their offerings next, before buying a second iphone.
It is possible to remove the iTunes drm, so that&amp;#8217;s not a show stopper, the app store still seems buggy and has not impressed me much.</description>

<p>I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ll see, but my next laptop might not be a mac either. That means Julie will have to learn Linux. That would be her third new OS in under ten years. Good thing she is smart and adaptable.</p>

            <description>Just recently, I learned how to use tramp mode for working on our servers downtown. It could quite possibly be the most useful mode I have discovered in emacs; as far as helping me be more productive at work. It lets me stay in emacs for more things both on my local box and on the servers downtown all at the same time. Yay!Ã‚Â
Now, If I could only figure out how to get code from the database by function id and then edit it in my local version of emacs and save the changes back to the db.</description>

<p>Now, If I could only figure out how to get code from the database by function id and then edit it in my local version of emacs and save the changes back to the db. For me, this would eliminate having to copy the function code out of the web browser, paste into a new file in emacs, modify it, paste it back into the browser and save it and then run a test on it to see what I just broke.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>It is always a good day when you discover a little gem of knowledge.</p>

Hannah got another head Bonk this morning. She was walking around the bedroom while I was washing my face and ran into a corner. Her favorite food seems to be bananas (coincidence?). She hasn&amp;#8217;t given me any new signs lately but I am still giving her more, eat, mamma, pappa, dog, kitty and horse. Julie has been working with her object identification: where is the kitty? Where&amp;#8217;s papa, etc for most of those signs.</description>

            <title>5 Percent Increase</title>

            <description>If we open up offshore drilling we will only increase our domestic oil production by less than 5% by the year 2030. I highly doubt that this will have any impact on gas prices now or then. But, I&amp;#8217;d bet money in vegas that the oil company that does drill there will damage and/or ruin the ecosystem. When have they not damaged or ruined an ecosystem they have had leases in?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/usoilconsumption.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-250" title="Projected US Oil Consumption" src="http://192.241.192.98/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/usoilconsumption-246x300.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="300" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/usoilconsumption-246x300.jpg 246w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/usoilconsumption.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" /></a></p>

<p>If we open up offshore drilling we will only increase our domestic oil production by less than 5% by the year 2030. I highly doubt that this will have any impact on gas prices now or then. But, I&#8217;d bet money in vegas that the oil company that does drill there will damage and/or ruin the ecosystem. When have they not damaged or ruined an ecosystem they have had leases in?Ã‚Â</p>

<p>Ecosystems like ANWR are irreplaceable. They are sort of like the Mona Lisa in that diversity of life and the genomic warehouse they contain can never be re-created once they are gone. Is a Five percent increase (and no lower consumer gas prices) really worth it? Has America lost so much of its drive and innovation that it cannot find a better, more efficient and way to produce and consume energy? Will we ever find a way to exist in a more non-destructive paradigm?</p>

<p>Perhaps there is opportunity in the answers to my questions above.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Momma went to the movies last night. We got to hang out with the dogs and Bella. First I fed you dinner, a mixture of squash and something else orange. You had been snacking on cheese and were showing very little interest in eating so I let you use your own hands to feed yourself. While you were making a mess and feeding yourself I was able to get a few more spoonfuls in. I tried to get you to drink some of the whole milk we are starting you on but you were not a big fan of it.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was bath time. You really like bath time. I tried your momma&amp;#8217;s approach of putting you in the tub standing up while the water warmed up. Then we did some bubble bath soap and you were so interested in the bubbles that you stuck your face under the water. It was only a second before you stood straight up, gasping for air. I guess you wanted a closer look at the bubbles.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After bath time we took the dogs for a walk. Bella followed us to the mailboxes so we had to pick her up and take her back&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>to the house. We saw Mason out and dropped of the OSX Leopard Disc so Cory could upgrade his computer. Then we went around the school as usual and over to the Healthy Bone. I wanted to exchange the choke chain I got for Gurgi, the one I got onÃ‚Â SaturdayÃ‚Â is a little long. You were getting a little cranky so I hurried you home. I think you got tired of being in the stroller. You were no longer interested in the snack pack andÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â not the milk in the sippy cup.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>It was about 7pm when we got home so we played with your toys. You chased the kitty a little bit, climbed on your leopard skin rocking chair, knocked over a stack of buckets, nine high, several times and jumped on me while laughing and giggling. Oh yes you were really into hammering the toy that has plastic balls which go through the holes and then roll out the bottom. You are walking really well now, when you want, you can walkÃ‚Â acrossÃ‚Â the room in the little shoes we got for you. I think you will be running around by the time we get to Hawaii to see all four of your grandparents.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Hannah is walking. She is catching her balance, looking for objects to walk to and use as a balance waypoint and still tripping and falling alot 😉
The weekend we got her some new shoes that will help her motor around. Since the weather is starting to turn we also got her some cool new hats.</description>

            <description>I was feeding Hannah breakfast this morning and she showed me the sign for more! She really enjoyed herÃ‚Â bananaÃ‚Â and oatmeal cereal with yogurt. Almost every time I asked her, &amp;#8220;More eat?&amp;#8221; she did the more sign. It was really cool to see my little girlÃ‚Â communicatingÃ‚Â with me on her own level and I look forward to many more interesting conversations with her. I am especially interested in her world view as she grows and her experiences take her into the wide, wide world.</description>

<p>It&#8217;s getting cold at night now, last night it got down to the upper 40&#8217;s. Fall is just around the corner along with Hannah&#8217;s one year birthday.</p>

            <description>Labor Day is for doing labor, right? Anywho, I re-did the side to make it look less getto and to stop Mr. Gurgi from esacaping. Alas, when we did a test run by taking Hannah to the pool, one last time before summer ends, he escaped and was in the back yard! Julie thinks he jumped on the dog house and then jumped the fence and that&amp;#8217;s why he couldn&amp;#8217;t get back over.</description>

            <description>Julie told me this morning that Hannah signed &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; to Marie yesterday. When Marie feeds her lunch she says &amp;#8220;More&amp;#8221; but usually doesn&amp;#8217;t sign it. Hannah gave her the sign when she said it.
This morning when I was holding Hannah she gave me a big, sloppy open mouthed wet kiss instead of turning away and giggling like she usually does. That made my doy no matter what happens.</description>

            <description>I have the side yard (dog run) apart while I fill in the low areas of backfill around the foundation that has sunk. I am also putting a split rail fence, that T&amp;#8217;s off the fenceÃ‚Â separatingÃ‚Â our yard form the neighbors house, with a gate to seperate side yard from back yard. I&amp;#8217;ll also need to spread some some cover material that is not river rock. River rock is quite possibly the worst landscaping material I have ever seen or worked with.</description>

<p>In other ToDo news, I need to look at the Murano brake pads as they are getting close to needing replacement. Its a good thing we have a long Labor Day weekend coming up 🙂</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night Julie and I decided that your first real word is &amp;#8220;Hi.&amp;#8221; You say hi to everything and its really funny. We were sitting outside on the patio having dinner and you said hi to both Gurgi and Whitney, Bella and a plane flying by in the sky. This morning on the walk to The Heathers, you said hi to the clouds, a few houses, the guy walking his dog, Bella who was following us and Mason and Marie when we got inside the house.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to remember to bring the video camera to your room when I put you to sleep so I can have it there when you wake up in the morning. Thats when you are most talkative. You are getting better at walking. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet but Marie says you can take 6 steps on your own without any assistance. I betcha that by the time we get to Maui in October you will be mostly walking on your own.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your other recent behavior is to point (and say &amp;#8220;Hi&amp;#8221;). You really like it when I point back at you and touch you ET style. You still like to High-Five but pointing is&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night Julie and I decided that your first real word is &#8220;Hi.&#8221; You say hi to everything and its really funny. We were sitting outside on the patio having dinner and you said hi to both Gurgi and Whitney, Bella and a plane flying by in the sky. This morning on the walk to The Heathers, you said hi to the clouds, a few houses, the guy walking his dog, Bella who was following us and Mason and Marie when we got inside the house.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>I need to remember to bring the video camera to your room when I put you to sleep so I can have it there when you wake up in the morning. Thats when you are most talkative. You are getting better at walking. I haven&#8217;t seen it yet but Marie says you can take 6 steps on your own without any assistance. I betcha that by the time we get to Maui in October you will be mostly walking on your own.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>Your other recent behavior is to point (and say &#8220;Hi&#8221;). You really like it when I point back at you and touch you ET style. You still like to High-Five but pointing is</p>

<p>where its at for now.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>Summer is almost over and the nights are getting much cooler and shorter as well. Seeing how summer is almost over I need to finish cleaning up the patio and make a real dog run for Gurgi and Whitney in the side yard. The plan is to move all the clay that I removed for the retaining wall over to the east side of the house to fill in the low spots where the backfill has sunk and level it off a little bit. Then I am going to &#8220;t&#8221; off of the existing split rail fence over to the house and make a real gate. The final step will be to lay down some landscapers material and get a few tons of pebble sized rocks so that we can at least walk on it. Oh yes, I also still need to fix the electrical where the backfill sunk and pulled the pipe down. This will make the side yard a little easier to use as a dog run and entry way to the yard. My long term plan for it is to make a path of pavers that leads to the patio.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Hannah is hard at work trying to learn to walk. She really doesn&amp;#8217;t like to crawl much, I don&amp;#8217;t think it is fast enough for her. Every day she gets more adventurous with her walking attempts. I see her just standing there practicing her balance alot; her stance reminds me of a snowboarder or skater stance when you are riding at speed. Besides practicing her balance by standing there, sometimes she coordinates everything together and can take 4-5 steps no problem. Other times the coordination things messes up her plans and she loses her balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend we went up near Lyons to visit a co-worker of Julie&amp;#8217;s who has a son, Logan, very close to Hannah&amp;#8217;s age. They were playing together and crawling around all over the place. When we went out to their deck Hannah tried to walk through the door but got tripped up coming through the doorway. She fell forward and bonked her face 🙁 A few minutes later all was better cause she was in Mommas arms and we noticed that she had a tiny bit of blood inside one of her nostrils. Her first bloody nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had anouther pretty active weekend. Saturday after getting breakfast at&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We had anouther pretty active weekend. Saturday after getting breakfast at</p>

<p>the farmers market we did a short 45 minute hike. We started at Settlers peak and hiked up to the top. Going up the trail was pretty good but the trail we came down was a little sketchy (I was only wearing Tevas and I am sure that didn&#8217;t help). The dogs had fun playing in the creeks we crossed and socializing with the other dogs my co-workers brought. Then we grilled out in the park and played a little in the creek. We had mexican for dinner and got to order Hannah her first kids meal at a restaurant. She decided to get cheese quesadillas. Then Julie and I took her to the last Erie concert in the park. I forget the band that played but it was fun and Hannah got to dance with us and walk around to see everything that was going on. Another very good weekend. This picture is of me and my little geek girl. I am looking at the video camera and she is looking at the camera case. Ah, pretty soon she will have her own logins on my systems and all of that fun stuff.</p>

            <description>Hannah, you crack me up. There are little bruises that ate migrating around your forehead. I can see how it hurts you when you Bonk your heavy little head. But sometimes, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s really funny and your momma and I can&amp;#8217;t help buy laugh.
Like tonight when we were lying on the floor playing, crawling and reading books and you were so happy. You werr just sitting there babbling and jumping on us and then I gave you the moracca.</description>

You excitedly took it from me and promptly bonked your self in the head with it. I think the worldnended for you and for the next few minutes, while we tried not to laugh to much, you were completely inconsolable. Then after you prostrated yourself in childs pose a few times and threw yourself onto momma a couple times you gotn better and went on reading a book.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I rode the 25 mile loop near Gold Hill Trailhead. Still can&amp;#8217;t do it under four hours but it is still a pretty fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we took Hannah on her first real hike with Whitney and Gurgi. We walked the 7.5 mile loop at Walker Ranch and it aeems i wore everyone out: dogs, daughter and wife. Towards the end J and I got annoyed with each other but worked it out. We may be in trouble when Hannah learns the art of manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner I went out to Bo and threw the saddle on him for a few laps. He did well, I can almost get him to do a few large circles at a gallup. Got bit up by moaquitos, we need to bring some bug spray out to keep with the tack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this I am getting some quality one one one Hannah time. Litterly, she is using me as a pillow before I put her down for the night. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it helps her sleep through the night better or not, but I like to spend this quit time with her just reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was definatly in the moment this weekend. I&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>We went to San Diego this weekend and Hannah had a blast. I think it wore her out a little bit though. She got to meed Scott and Sarah&amp;#8217;s new puppy, Aggie and she got to see her Grandma Cheryle and Grandpa Paul while Julie and I went to a wedding. She had a great time with her grandparents and then On Sunday we took her to the San Diego Cove.</description>

She got to meed Scott and Sarah&#8217;s new puppy, Aggie and she got to see her Grandma Cheryle and Grandpa Paul while Julie and I went to a wedding. She had a great time with her grandparents and then On Sunday we took her to the San Diego Cove. By then, I think she was grateful for any sleep so she napped most of the time.</p>

<p>The wedding was very nice and it was a lot of fun to be out with Julie. Had a great time.</p>

<p>Things to try and get done this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Patio bricks need more sand and a bit of leveling</li>
<li>move dirt &#8211; get ready to put in a fence</li>
<li>return tools to Mike (wheelbarrow) and Robert (level)</li>
<li>ride out and back from the Gold Hill Trail head (Sunday am)</li>
</ul>

            <description>It hot here for the 29th day in a row so I thought I would give the pups a break from the hundred degree days we have been getting in Erie. I brought them into the office and took this picture on one of their breaks outside. It&amp;#8217;s really cool that I can bring them to work with me. I doubt that I could ever do that at companies like Amgen.</description>

            <description>Hannah was super tired last night. I took her for a walk with the pups last night while Julie went out to Mr. Bo. She fell asleep about halfway into it and then didn&amp;#8217;t want to go to sleep when we got back.
She is pretty funny when she tries to keep herself awake. It seems like she gets so tired that she gets more energy and excited so she can do more things before she crashes.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We had a great weekend, even though we missed Julie. While she was off in Cancun relaxing Hannah spent the weekend with my parents showing them her tricks: waving, standing and taking baby steps. When she wants something she is willing to let go of her support and take a step or two towards the object of her desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the bricks returned and the yard work done and even got Hannah some new sandals for the summertime. Even with my parents here, it is hard to take care of Hannah by myself. THe longer Julie was gone I noticed more little things that she did which are easy to take fro granted. I was glad to pick her up last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, Dad got the truck running again, apparently when I changed the plugs and wires I crossed cylinders 1 and 8). Dodge has a strange firing order on the &amp;#8217;97 Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things to do this week before we leave for San Diego:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix the electrical (Measure the diameter of the pvc pipe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset the middle sprinkler range at the top of the backyard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;reset the bricks where the ants dug sand up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;reset the bricks around the edge where it has settled a quarter&lt;/li&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a strange feeling to go over the M&amp;amp;S&amp;#8217;s last night with Julie gone and myÃ‚Â parentsÃ‚Â watching Hannah. Hannah did great last night. WeÃ‚Â wentÃ‚Â through her usual routine of playing, eating, and shower. Since it was only 6:30 Papa Rosa and I went to the auto part store to get a new distributer cap andÃ‚Â rotorÃ‚Â thingy. Hannah came with us and took a light nap on the way there. The auto store woke her up though and she stayed awake until we got home. She wasn&amp;#8217;t quite all the way tired so Mom played with her till she put her to bed. She stayed down all night! It was reported to me yesterday that she can stand on her own and take three or four steps at a time all by herself. I&amp;#8217;ll have to get a video of that. I can maybe post it on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah woke up this morning is a very smiley mood. She drank her bottle in less than ten minutes and then started crawling all over me and looking at the animals. We got up and went downstairs to get breakfast ready and Momma Rosa made Papa Rosa feed Hannah. She&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>wants Hannah to get more comfortable with him. Apparently Hannah does to my Dad the same thing she does to me when Julie is around. If Mom comes into the room and Dad and Hannah are playing, Hannah gets upset and wants Mom to come over to her and pay attention. Sound familiar? 🙂 We are going to go to the Concert in the Park tonight and I will try to post some pictures on the webpage for you byÃ‚Â tomorrowÃ‚Â morning. Depending on how things go tonight I might try to go see the new X-Files movie at one of the later showings. Everyone at work raves about the Dark NIght so we shall have to find some time to go see that when you get back.</p>

<p>I started to read GEB last night before I went to sleep. The intro is very interesting and it reminds me alot of the Seven Mysteries Of Life book from the 60&#8217;s. It&#8217;s long but itÃ‚Â shouldÃ‚Â be a good read.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Silver Rush MTB race was fun but I didn&amp;#8217;t finish. Grrr, I am annoyed with myself for taking to many breaks. I got to the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; way point in 4 hours and 10 minutes and the cutoff time was four hours. Next year besides the AM Train I will need to ride the HA (High Altitude) Train alot more. I plan on going up to the colorado trail between Frisco and Breckenridge and doing that as an out and back. It won&amp;#8217;t be fifty miles but it should be close to forty and its at a decently high altitude. Riding or pushing a bike at 11,000+ feet is pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news; she is waving, almost saying Hi and crawling with a peg leg. She uses one leg to crawl like normal and the other leg is used with the foot flat on the ground to propel her around. She is pretty quick when she seesÃ‚Â somethingÃ‚Â she wants to go after like Momma, the dogs food dishes or the Bella the cat. Her legs are getting a bit of balance in them. I have seen her stand up unassisted, with no hands, for almost 20-30 seconds and she is taking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>her furniture surfing to anouther level. When she sees something that she can use for support she edges herself as close to it as she can get from her current support object and then tries to reach it with her hands. If she can reach it she goes over otherwise she sits down and thinks about it before crawling over to it.</p>

<p>Momma Rosa and Pappa Rosa are in town this week to get some quality Hannah time in so Hopefully she will have lots of fun with them.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmm, last night was an interesting night. You would NOT go down for momma, even when she took you to bed with her. I took over around 10:30 or so and we sat in the rocking chair in the corner of your room. Last week I put a night light in there so that you don&amp;#8217;t wake up in a total black out. Last night you discovered light and shodows. For almost thirty minutes you watched me make one handed shadow puppets and move my head around. Then, I tried to get you to do them. after a few minutes of me holding your arm out into the light you started to move it around. I think you made the connection beteen the movement of your arm and the movement of the shadow on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also like to be talked to. You were interested in the shadows on the ceiling so I told you all about what we were doing with the shadows (making one handed puppets); then, when you started rubbing your eyes I started talking you down to sleep. I told you about the geometry of trees (really all plants). How the branches off the main stem can&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>be measured in terms of angles and rotation. When you finally put your head on my shoulder and went under a little bit, I switched to a softer voice and mumbled stuff about sleep stages and elves. After I put you down in your crib you stll wanted some company so I massaged your back for a little bit and you seemed to like that. It helped you go back to sleep. Once you were snoring I slipped out of the room.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Very busy this week. I did an AM Train on monday but haven&amp;#8217;t ridden since then. GOAL: make to the 1&amp;frasl;2 way point in under 4 hours!
When Julie is sick and Hannah can&amp;#8217;t have unlimited access to her momma, Hannah gets cranky. She is getting very curious about her environment, crawling around and trying to pull herself up on all kinds of things. I need to do the stair gates because she likes to climb.</description>

The door and cupboards need locks and we shall fasten several pieces of furniture to the wall (Faulkner Library in the living room, the bookshelf in Hannah&#8217;s room and theÃ‚Â armoireÃ‚Â in Hannah&#8217;s room</p>

<p>Work stuff thats keeping me hopping: trying to figure out a perl script to do a custom data transfer for forbes(not working) and I need to figure out why my xmlHttpRequest is working in firefox but not crappy internet explorer for the rjr-pingback offer.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannahs MOST FUN THING TO DO, lately, has been to pull herself up on something and then let go. She flaps her arms like a bird and tries to balance on two legs. The longest she can balance is for 10 &amp;#8211; 15 seconds. She is also starting to look at other objects that she can balance on and edge her self close to them. I can see her thinking, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll bet I can run to that before I fall!&amp;#8221; A little birdie is telling me that she will be walking before to long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also started saying &amp;#8220;OH!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is after we tell her &amp;#8220;NO!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its kinda funny. We are still workign on some basic signs with her: Eat, More, No, gentle Mamma and Pappa. Nothing back yet but I think she might be starting to get the communicaiton thing. She is sleeping well. What is working now is that she will go down with Julie around 8:30 &amp;#8211; 9:00 and then I&amp;#8217;ll take her into her crib when I come to bed, later. For the last few days she has been sleeping through the night until about 5:45am or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged about 120 miles last week, mostly on the AM&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Train. I did 16 miles at winter park and had to walk some of the Icarus Trail &#8211; the rear drive train was acting funny so I didn&#8217;t want to mess up the chain. I did get some good climbing at altitude in though SHould be ready for next Saturday. Remember your goal: 25 miles in 3.5 hours.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh Hannah, you were so lonely last night. It broke my heart when I went into your room and you were sitting there looking at the little turtle lights and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I got the diaper situation in line and then rocked you back to sleep. It took a few position changes on your part, but we got you comfortable. Then, after you fell asleep, I held you a little longer so I could listen to the tiny snore that was coming from your cute little button nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little kiddo is getting bigger, but not so big just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really not a fan of riding a bike on the road, even commuter riding. Although, i was thinking today when I rode in that if I could ride three days a week that would save almost 120 miles of driving per week or:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6000 miles per year (assuming my company keeps us at only two weeks of vacation a year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 less fill ups for the Murano&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1350 less on gas per year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a lower resting heart rate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I saw five or six bannan peels on the side of the road when I was riding in, today they were all gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I did a training ride on Saturday, 25 miles on the colorado trail. I started from the Gold Hill Mine trailhead and went clockwise (if you are lookign east. It took just about 4 hours total time but only 3 hours and 20 minutes of actual ride time. I took several breaks and stopped to make sure I was still on the Colorado trail a few times. Going up, though I got winded several times on the switch backs and had to take a breather. 50 miles is going to be tough. I think I&#8217;ll be able to make the four hour cutoff though. Thats my goal&#8230;. just finish.</p>

            <title>Patio Done :: Hannah Almost Crawling</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Patio is done, whew. Julie helped tremendously and I think it was more work than she realized. She was also able to take care of Hannah alot of the time so kudos to her for multi tasking. Cory helped to and its prolly because of him that we got done yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My estimated totals are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bricks and wall blocks moved &amp;#8211; 10,000 to 12,000 lbs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall foundation and road base moved &amp;#8211; 22 tons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason sand for paver leveling &amp;#8211; 2.5 tons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment rentals &amp;#8211; one paver saw for a day, one 225lb 14&amp;#8243; ground pounder rented twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned &amp;#8211; estimated wall block and pavers is not an exact science&amp;#8230; we have almost a pallet extra of rectangular pavers (but just the right amount of square pavers) and we have about &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a pallet of extra wall blocks. Next time I need to hire a day laborer to help move stuff from the front the back and seriously consider renting one of the hand powered front end loaders to help with moving/loading/excavating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hannah news she is standing like mad (with assistance) and can almost push herself up into a sitting position on her own. I give it a week ands she will be sitting up&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>on her own. The same goes for crawling. When she is in a sitting position she will see something she wants that is just out of reach and lean forward like she is going to crawl to it but then she seems to think about it and decides to wait just a little bit longer.</p>

<p>It is really time to order some baby proofing stuff. We need the portable baby pens, top and bottom stair gates and cupboard locks to start with.</p>]]></content>

            <description>I have had a hard time getting back to making regular posts since Vegas. I have also had a hard time getting in my training rides for the 50 mile MTB race coming up. I want to at least be able to finish it in under 7.5 hours.
Hannah is growing so fast now. All she wants to do is stand up. You can put her between the couch and the ottoman and she bounces back and forth moving all around until she plops down.</description>

<p>Hannah is growing so fast now. All she wants to do is stand up. You can put her between the couch and the ottoman and she bounces back and forth moving all around until she plops down. It is good that Marie is teaching her to plop. It saves her bopping her head on the floor.</p>

<p>Got about 75% of the patio installed last weekend. Julies parents were out and she helped me move alot of the materials. It would be so much easier if we could get the materials dropped off in the back yard. Rough totals: 22 tons of rock and road base and about 7000 pounds of wall block. It looks good. The pavers will be dropped off tonight and i&#8217;ll just slowly move them back there this week. I would not have been able to move the road base on Saturday without help from Cory and Dans.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Busted in Vegas. It seems that people play jack 4 offsuit offline as well as online. Hah. Oh well, I guess that even though he was playing like a maniac, I should have thought a little more before calling his all in with only top pair after the flop. I played good other that that, there was just one other really bad call that I made. Until I lost to MR J4o I was up about $200, the pot with the maniac was the biggest pot I have ever been in before ($475) I am letting people draw too much I think and I could use a healthy dose of aggression to my game. Other times I bet the flop with what I thought was the best hand but didn&amp;#8217;t follow up on the turn and let one person get a straight and another person get to a flush draw. Hmm, need to start being more aggressive post flop when I play strong hands and hit part of the flop. That might give me more information if I bet or reraise when I am in position. Other that those types of hands (and the J4o) I played well from position. Had&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Busted in Vegas. It seems that people play jack 4 offsuit offline as well as online. Hah. Oh well, I guess that even though he was playing like a maniac, I should have thought a little more before calling his all in with only top pair after the flop. I played good other that that, there was just one other really bad call that I made. Until I lost to MR J4o I was up about $200, the pot with the maniac was the biggest pot I have ever been in before ($475) I am letting people draw too much I think and I could use a healthy dose of aggression to my game. Other times I bet the flop with what I thought was the best hand but didn&#8217;t follow up on the turn and let one person get a straight and another person get to a flush draw. Hmm, need to start being more aggressive post flop when I play strong hands and hit part of the flop. That might give me more information if I bet or reraise when I am in position. Other that those types of hands (and the J4o) I played well from position. Had</p>

<p>fun but am still upset at losing all my chips to the dude with J4o. One other thing to note, I saw very effective use (against me and other &#8216;fish&#8217; at the table) of a 2x reraise on the turn and on the river. These bets were usually between 30-75 dollars and made me fold average hands after they checked, I bet and they re-raised. Useful information for the next time I play 1-2NL.</p>

<p>Hannah was sick this week. Running a temp and cranky! I took a sick day yesterday to stay home with her and she would go through a period of being fine and playing and then two minutes later she would just want to be held. Not to many smiles form her though so I hope she gets better soon and we see the return of her sunny personality. She slept ok last night, I brought her to bed around midnight and put her to bed with me. Julie needed a good night sleep so she went to the guest bedroom. Hannah woke up a few times but easily went back to sleep when I cuddled with her.</p>

<p>I hate river rock. Whoever decided to make that a standard part of landscaping should be forced to remove it from my backyard. Whatever happend to xeroscaping with mulch beds and low water use perennials? Right now I am removing the stupid river rock from where the patio will be so I can start to build the retaining wall it will need. The retaining wall will not have to be as tall as I initially thought. Oh, is this going to be a pain in the ass! And after college I though I was done with landscaping forever. Hah!</p>

<p>I need to reinstall the latest wordpress upgrade, I noticed that myÃ‚Â categoriesÃ‚Â are broken 🙁</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;We felt and saw Hannahs fourth tooth on Sunday. She is getting closer to sitting up and, when sitting up, she is starting to lean forward in order to grab things that she wants. This morning, in bed, it was funny cause she would topple over and immediatly go into roll mode. Thats my girl &amp;#8230; she is already learning the proper way to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple gives a one year warranty for most of its products. My phone has been acting up so I took it in for some trouble shooting. They walked you through the usual steps of resetting the network connections and restoring the software but nothing really helped. People who were calling me still kept hearing echos on thier end. When I went back I was pleasantly surprised that the tech at teh Genius Bar just popped out my SIM card and swapped it into a new phone. This time I got the rubber condom for protection, but no belt clip for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lilac Circle Papas are headed to Vegas thursday night. I want to play tight/aggressive and double up my money. I am taking three buy ins for the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NL game and expect that good things will&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This late night Hannah fun is from two days ago. I had my server off for a few days so I am posting it now. She went to bed with Momma and woke up a bit earlier than usual, around 10:15pm. When she woke, boy was she ever conversational. She was talking and talking and just talking to herself i think. She talked to me all the way through her diaper change. She talked to the computer as I was shutting it down. She talked to Bella the cat when we let her out into the garage, to hunt mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since she was conversational I took her into the nursery and sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to her. Well, I sang the two verses I could remember over and over. Curious as ever, she started feeling my throat while I was singing. I think it helped her find her voice cause she started singing too. She sang and hummed and cooed her way to sleep on my right shoulder instead of the usual left side. This time, when I put her down in the crib she barely made a sound. She just rolled onto her side and that was that, off like&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>a light switch.</p>

<p>When I write a program i sometime use variables as place holders or counters that will track the progress function that uses looping to do some work for me. Everytime your program goes through the loop you have to tell it to increment the counter variable. If I have a variable named &#8216;counter&#8217; then I can use a shorthand notation to &#8216;increment counter.&#8217; This is done by writitng this: counter++. Now you understand the teeth++ above. The current value of Hannah&#8217;s teeth variable is 3.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;You and momma went to bed early, around 8:00 or so. I watched &amp;#8216;Planet Earth&amp;#8217; for a little while and then I heard you at 10:00. You were happily awake. We went into the laundry room and got you set up with a fresh, dry diaper. The whole time you were talking and looking at stuff. Did you like the shadows made by the batheroom light? Were you trying to tell me that you were happy? Then we went into the routine fall asleep mode. I start by putting you on my left side with my arms keeping you close to my shoulder. We walk around for a little bit and then, because you are getting so big now, I sit down in the rocker. Now you stop talking and start getting comfortable. First you rest your little head on top of my shoulder. Then you nuzzle into the side of my neck. You are so warm and pleasent smelling, I softly hum a little bit to lull you under but you like to fight sleep for a bit. This time, the only sounds you make are getting comfortable sounds. When my neck doesn&amp;#8217;t twork out for you, you sink lower&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When my neck doesn&#8217;t twork out for you, you sink lower</p>

<p>and rest your head on my chest. This is new for you since it makes you be more lateral and on your stomach. It almost works but not quite yet; you straighten your legs and pull your self back up to my shoulder. As I hum you try the outside of my shoulder but that makes your neck tilt at an awkward angle. This time, when I hum a familiar melody (Twinkle Twinkle Little Star), I pull your head back over to the crook in between my shoulder and neck. Its like magic, your arms relax and the feet stop moving. your breathing starts to slow and I breath slower too. I try to take one breath for every two of yours. I hope this helps you relax. Your breath slows even more and there are minor twitches happening in your small hands and feet. Your beathing slows even more and I match it with my own. You are just about to go under so I firmly press you to my body and stand up. I gently lower you into the crib and hold you close as long as I can. You only startle a once and then relax onto your back. I think that you like your side better so I roll you over to it and you put one arm under your head while the other one just dangles in from of your face. Every thing was just right this time, I timed it perfectly.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode into work today to get some extra riding in. Its weird, but when it is colder the air seems fresher or something. This morning and there was lots of tailpipe to smoke. To bad that&amp;#8217;s not what I like to smoke. Anyways, ride stats are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Distance &amp;#8211; 37.52 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Time &amp;#8211; 2:10:39 hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average Speed &amp;#8211; 17.23 mph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Speed &amp;#8211; 35.80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I think I&amp;#8217;ll get up a little early and try to get over 60 miles in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news: I went in to get her at her usual wakeup time of 5:15 and she was sleeping on her Stomach! That&amp;#8217;s huge for little miss &amp;#8216;I do not like to spend any time on my tummy&amp;#8217; 🙂 She is also able to stand up for a short time if you lean her against the couch. Yay! I am sure she will want to go snowboarding with us next year 😉 Julei and I have started practicing her crawling coordination. What is that you ask? Well let me tell you. We put Hannah on her back and one of us takes the legs while the other takes the arms. Then we alternate each side in a pseudo crawling motion. It&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We put Hannah on her back and one of us takes the legs while the other takes the arms. Then we alternate each side in a pseudo crawling motion. It</p>

<p>is right leg to left arm and then do the opposite set. She seems to like it for a few minutes but I don&#8217;t think she has let us do it for the whole 10 minutes that we try work her out for. It rather funny cause I think she gets bored. Then she starts extending her legs and arching her back. Her little way of telling us ok that was fun but really, lets move on to something else.</p>

<p>In puppy dog news we found out who was sneaking into the back yard and doing small amounts of damage while we were away. Mr Gurgi was able to pull out the stakes to the fence that seperates the side yard from the back yard and he would spend the day eating the cable coaxal line and puling branches off hte trees. Then, I&#8217;m sure because he knew it was time for us to come home, he would join Whitney back in the side yard looking as innocent as ever. I added more stakes and that seems to have stopped him for now. It also might be the five mile runs we are doing 2-3 times a week on topÃ‚Â of the nightly walks.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Went for a training ride around Anthem and Vista Ridge this morning. Started out on a little loop. But ehen I came around by Bo&amp;#8217;s stable I decided to keep going up to highway 52. Over to county line road and then back through Anthem turned my ride into a big loop. I did a second smaller loop for good measure and made it back home before ten am.Ã‚Â

<p><strong>Ride Stats</strong></p>

<p>Distance: 38.60 miles</p>

<p>Ride Time: 2:26.40</p>

<p>Average Speed: 15.78 mph</p>

<p>Max Speed: 35.80 mph</p>

<p>The max speed wasÃ‚Â achievedÃ‚Â on the second loop around Anthem. Coming up to the bridge that crosses E470. Another highlight was seeing the balloon launch again but from a more distant perspective. That park over by Sheridan Pkwy might be a good place to watch the Balloon launch next year if we want to miss the traffic and bring the dogs. We could bring a picnic breakfast. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Today around the house Hannah is helping momma fix up her railing boxesÃ‚Â withÃ‚Â perennials and we also got a tree, i think its vibram.</p>

            <description>I rode to work yesterday. Total ride time was 2:22. Total distance was ~37 miles. If I worked in the loop near Vista Ridge I should be able to make it more than 50 miles. Felt pretty good, I averaged a bit better than 15mph. Will need many more of these before the silverton 50.
We got up early this am and took Hannah to the balloon launch at the VR clubhouse.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hanna woke up earlier than usual last night, around 10:30. Julie was aleady asleep so I went to go comfort her. I think she had a scary dream and woke up all alone. She does not like to be alone right now because she calmed down when I changed her diaper and lulled her back to sleep on my shoulder while rocking gently in the corner of her room. I can only try to describe how pleasant I&amp;#8217;d felt to have her nuzle her face into the crook of my shoulder and her left arm around my neck. She was warm, content and I think she just wanted someone there while she fell back to sleep. I hope she had better dreams the second time around. Maybe she saw Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was a good one. One that, upon reflection, I can look back on and say that life is really good. Saturday we got a few things around the house done and I went out to Bo while Julie spent quality time with Hannah and took Whitney to the Vet &amp;#8211; she has an ear infection. In the afternoon, I got a workout in at the gym. I rode for 30&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the afternoon, I got a workout in at the gym. I rode for 30</p>

<p>minutes but could not stand the stationary bike any more than that. It was too windy to ride outside in the afternoon so that will have to do. Then we went over to the Manes&#8217; house and Hannah and I played wii while the girls had a night out. Hannah didn&#8217;t want to sleep and was alittle bit grumpy &#8230; I think she is getting a second tooth in.</p>

<p>I want to start on the sg::malu story soon. The first part is still a little fuzzy but the second part has gotten pretty clear in the last few months. My goal for the end of this summer is to transcribe my notes into the wp installation at the site.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;No traveling, nothing urgent to do this past weekend and good time spent with Hannah made the weekend alot of fun. It started on Friday night when we got all the children together for some dinner. They were very cute playing together. Then we had some Wii time, Smash Bros &amp;amp; Martio Kart. A couple of beers and then off to bed.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up pretty early and were ready to go hiking on Saturday morning. Just around Betasso Preserve loop ~3.2 miles. Hannah did good on her second training hike, She fell asleep towards the end. On our way back home we stopped for an early lunch at the farmers market. Then it was off to home for a mid day nap. It was a very good nap. Woke up around 3:00 or so and played with Hannah some more while Julie went out to see Mr Bo. We had dinner and put Hannah to bed at her usual time and then watched a movie, Juno. It was pretty good. It gave me an idea for how to manage my Netflix queue. Instead of waiting for them to recommend a move for me, I just look at what is currently&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It gave me an idea for how to manage my Netflix queue. Instead of waiting for them to recommend a move for me, I just look at what is currently</p>

<p>playing at the theater that I want to see and request it. It seems like all of the current titles are already in there and you can just get on the waiting list. I don&#8217;t like the wayÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â recommendationÃ‚Â engine works and it seems harder to find all of the current releases that are playing in theaters now.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>Sunday I slept in until around 8:30 or so and got ready for a productive day. We tried to take the Volvo in for tire rotation but itÃ‚Â doesn&#8217;tÃ‚Â need it for 3K more miles. We ran some more errands and then I came home and changed the oil in the Murano while Julie potted a couple of flowers for the front porch. Hannah supervised while in her bouncy walker &amp; Gurgi &amp; Whitney were on guard. We tried to get Hannah to take a nap in the afternoon, she was giving all the tired signs but fighting it, but she wouldn&#8217;t go down for a nap so Julie took her over to play with her friend Shaye. I went for a short bike ride and started getting ready for the Silverton 50 in Leadville later this summer. I rode form our house to Anthem and then circled back to Highway 7 on Sheridan Pkwy. Then I went east on 7 to County Rd 7 and north to County Rd 6. I circled back towards Vista Ridge on County Rd 5 and them meandered through Vista Ridge back to the house. Total distance was about 17 miles. If I do that twice it should be a decent training ride for the S-50. THen we fed Miss Hannah dinner and put her down a little early on account of her not sleeping all day. She slept ok, woke up a few times but put herself back under. I think Julie got up withÃ‚Â herÃ‚Â at 1:30.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Yesterday Marie reported that Hannah popped her first tooth. That explains why she was so cranky Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in San Francisco. Yeah, she only has 19 more to go 😉
On tap for tonight, after Julie gets home from picking up the Volvo is Wii at the Heathers, I think Cory got the Super Mario Carts game and I just got the Super Smash brothers game so it should be fun.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a cold wet ride in to Boulder. It was about 40 degree when I left Erie and not raining. By the time I got to Lafayette it had started raining and by the time I came into Boulder it was snowing. I wish my truck was running today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Just got back from four days in San Francisco and I found out how hard it is to work and watch Hannah. I think she is getting bored pretty easily now. I noticed that she is happy entertaining herself for a little while, maybe half an hour. Then she wants some attention or different stimulation. In the mornign she would have her naps and play sessions and I could get some stuff done but then she would get fussy. By the time I went out to meet Julie for lunch she would be a bit cranky. Then I would put on the Bjorn and one of her hats (tangent: i got her a really cute reversible green and white / light green and pink flowers hat that straps on below her chin) and out we would go. As soon as we got into the elevator she would start smiling at anyone near&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>and then when we got outside she would go into a focused hyper alert mode. I think she was seeing everything and trying to make sense of all the crazyness.</p>

<p>I need to fix the truck. Hopefully it just needs new plugs and a new wiring harness.</p>]]></content>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, running out the door to work Julie stopped me and said, &amp;#8220;Hey come here I have something for you to do.&amp;#8221;Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reply was to sigh and so ok, what is it. SInce my mind was already out the door on my day, and the noon bike ride I had planned.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;#8221; come upstairsÃ‚Â with me&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave me Hannah when I got to the top of the stairs. Holding my daughter I followed her in to the office where she got her camera and then led us into theÃ‚Â nursery. &amp;#8220;We are going to take pictures of the Giraffes for your Aunt Lulu,&amp;#8221; she said. A light bulb went off in my mind.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sat Hannah in her boppy and took a seat next to her. The Giraffes are thirty two years apart in age but you can tell that they are related. Mine has faded white fuzzy skin, ragged hair on its main and dilapidated horns on top of its head. It is still standing but it kind of leans over to the one side now.Ã‚Â Hannah&amp;#8217;sÃ‚Â Giraffe is a little taller, completely full of stuffing and bright, bright yellow. My giraffe stood next&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>to me and Hannah pulled hers into her lap and smiled for the camera. Such a little cutie.Ã‚Â</p>

<p>Aunt Lulu is actually my Grandma Iacobucci&#8217;s sister and she makes several stuffed animals for a hobby. Thinking of Aunt Lulu&#8217;s craftiness reminded me of Grandma I. I wish Hannah could meet her. THe amazing thing about Aunt Lulu&#8217;s design is that it is so simple. There is just a fuzzy skin, some longer, soft string for a mane, and some kind of firm stuffing. There are no beads or buttons for eyes but You can still tell that is is a giraffe, well I can. I remember when Julie fist saw mine, I think she was a little creeped out because her mid twenties boyfriend still had a stuffed animal in his closet. I think she called it a horse but I am not sure. I was offended andÃ‚Â immediatelyÃ‚Â corrected her. 🙂</p>]]></content>

  tummy time is starting to go from her back to her front when she sees something interesting that she wants. If you put her down on her stomach, sheÃ‚Â immediatelyÃ‚Â flips over 180 degrees to her back. but if something catches her eye she will reach and twist most of her body over to tummy side to get what she wants.Ã‚Â </div>]]></content>

    On Friday, when I fed Hannah dinner, she started a new behavior. When I gave her the sign for &amp;#8216;eat&amp;#8217; and showed her the spoonful of baby food she opened her mouth like a little birdie. It was very cute. She did it until she got full or tired of the repetition. Watching her this past weekend I saw that she is starting to give signs of wanting but I don&amp;#8217;t think she knows she is doing it yet. Besides opening her mouth like a little bird, sheÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â has moments when she only wants Momma :)Ã‚Â
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Good weekend, great weather. We went for two &amp;#8216;hikes&amp;#8217; this weekend with Hannah. Last Saturday Julie and I got up early, went to breakfast at the farmers market on 11th St. Later we went up to the Bebaso trail/loop west of Boulder. Hannah first hike was fun. She fell asleep for the first half but was awake for the last mile or so.Ã‚Â On Sunday we went with Cory, Jen and Mason and walked around on the Boulder Creek Path. Both hikes were great little warmups and I look forward to some good backpacking with her.Ã‚Â

    We took the pups with us and they had a great time. I got repriminded by the dude form open spaces because Gurgi was not on a leash. Even though he was on heel next to my side. I saw a bunch of places where some well meaning person had but branches across the traiL,Ã‚Â ostentatiouslyÃ‚Â to stopÃ‚Â mountainÃ‚Â bikers from riding the line in the trail that takes you up the bank of the trail. I am not sure why they do this but is is pretty dangerous for theÃ‚Â mountainÃ‚Â bikers. Ã‚Â Boulders attitude to Mountain Bikers and Dogs is the weirdest I have seen; in all of the places I have lived. Apparently, open mindedness,Ã‚Â understandingÃ‚Â and harmonious living do not apply to Mountain Bikers and Canines.Ã‚Â

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Spring finally broke for good this past weekend. Hannah got to spend lots of time with her maternal grandparents. Paul and Cheryle drove up from Thousand Oaks for a long weekend. They watched Hannah while Julie and I cleaned the garage and patched all the cracks from the mud jacking. While I was turning on the sprinklers, Julie went out to ride Bo. Later that night we got a movie date night out of it while the grandparents put Hannah down to bed. From the &amp;#8216;report&amp;#8217; we got later that night she wasn&amp;#8217;t thrilled about not being put down by a regular (Me or Julie) but she rolled with it and let them calm her down and comfort her to lala land. For our date we went and saw 21, which i thought was ok but nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we got up early and Julie and I ran in the Canine Classic. It was fun, there were a ton of dogs everywhere and the weather was really nice. Not to hot, not too cold, just right for running 5 kilometers. After the race we went into Boulder for brunch and then went home for a nice mid afternoon siesta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not to hot, not too cold, just right for running 5 kilometers. After the race we went into Boulder for brunch and then went home for a nice mid afternoon siesta.</p>

<p>After we got up Julie, Hannah Cheryle and I went out to Bo. I rode for a little bit and got him up to a decent speed for me. After I was done warming him up, Julie rode for a bit too. We were going to try to take a Yoga class at the rec center but they told us the wrong time so I guess we&#8217;ll have to go next week.</p>

<p>Things I want to get done this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit the Easter footage and press a dvd</li>
<li>configure planner : remember : diary : muse</li>
<li>put some sg content into that wp install and find a suitably hackable theme to install</li>
<li>scan in the sign language pics and set up a j/s application to scroll through them like flashcard</li>
<li>seed and fill in the lawn with top soil.</li>
<li>ride the Betasso(sp?) loop on Tuesday and Thursday.</li>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;No tooth for Hannah yet. She was really happy this morning though and is still drooling like a mad baby and I am pretty sure that she does not have rabies. That means she is still getting closer to popping that first tooth. SHe is eating pretty well now, she really likes fruit. Julie told me that she ate the whole serving of bananas this morning.Ã‚Â It seems Hannah likes bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the eels show last night. Went with M my neighbor and a group of people. Was a good show at the Fox Theater in Boulder. A little crowded but atmosphere was pretty intimate and he puts on an entertaining show. He played a wide range of selections (old and new) and I found out that he is a really good drummer. Before the show they were playing the DVD that came out with his latest album. I saw that he also has a book so I found it on amazon this morning and placed an order. Should be an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It snowed today and I think that will hold up Cheryle and Paul. They stayed in Grand Junction last night and will get here today if there isn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Speaking of snow, maybe I can talk Cory into going up to Berthoud Pass this week end and getting some runs?Ã‚Â I expect that Paul and Cheryle will be happy that the weekend is supposed to be upper 60&#8217;s and sunny. I know I am. Hannah has started doing so many things since they last saw her; sitting up (almost on her own, very vocal, grabbing stuff, eating &#8216;real&#8217; baby food.</p>]]></content>

            <description>Any day now we expect Hannah to pop her first tooth. She is gumming anythign she can get into her mouth like crazy. Her fist, frozen rubber things with bumps on it, even my fingers. She is starting to like the solid food thing; at least from the output perspective that I have. We have had her on rive and whole grain cereal for about two weeks now and Julie just introduced some fruit this past weekend.</description>

Her fist, frozen rubber things with bumps on it, even my fingers. She is starting to like the solid food thing; at least from the output perspective that I have. We have had her on rive and whole grain cereal for about two weeks now and Julie just introduced some fruit this past weekend. Hannah seemed interested in the applesauce. Marie, Masons grandma, who takes care of them during the day told me that Hannah starts making funny faces after she gets full. She might not be a huge fan of the vegetables yet. Maybe she will like the fruit better.</p>

<p>For the record, I have cheated a few times and given her sugar just to see the look on her face. I think she liked it!</p>

<p>I still need to seal the mudjacking cracks in the garage, take off the carrier from the Murano, and clean out the garage with a high pressured sprayer. Prolly not in that order though.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Hannah is trying to &amp;#8216;train&amp;#8217; us 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night when I was putting her to bed she was fine if I held her, fine if I was giving here a little baby massage while lying in her crib on her side; but not fine if I stepped out of the room. I went to get something from the laundry room and she immediatly started crying. As soon as I came back into the room she stopped, but only for a second and then got louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took about ten minutes to relax her enough so that she was lulled into light sleep. I was able to slip out of the room then. I decided to give her five minutes to work things out for herself. She cried out a few times, each time getting softer and then sullenly went back to sleep. She stayed asleep until 1:30 or so when Julie took put her back down. Then she didn&amp;#8217;t wake us until 7:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dogs are still smarter than me, yesterday they got out of the yard and ran around the neighborhood like crazy boxers.Ã‚Â I got the other doggy fence from the basement and put it up so they&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>I went to Ohio for Easter this year. Katie and Rob came down from Montana and then we Drove from Colorado to Cleveland with Hannah and the pups. Total time on the road was right around 48 hours there and back. It only took about twenty hours to go city to city. Weather wise it was pretty good. On the way there we hit some snow in Chicago that got worse the closer we got to Cleveland but that was all.</description>

<p>Gurgi and Whitney got a little tired near the end of the adventure, so did everyone. Hannah did awsome. We did a lot of driving at night so she slept. But, during the day she was happy to smile, play with her toys and talk to everyone. We listened to a nineteen hour book on cd: Lisey&#8217;s Story by Steven King and I am the only one who liked it.</p>

            <description>I was carrying Hannah around and we were looking at stuff in the garage. She has been reaching for things for a few days now and recently she is getting her coordination dialed in. That is, she is getting what she reaches for. I was looking at my mountain bike when she reached out and grabbed a spoke on Julies road bike that is hanging from a hook. As I moved away she kept holding on.</description>

She has been reaching for things for a few days now and recently she is getting her coordination dialed in. That is, she is getting what she reaches for. I was looking at my mountain bike when she reached out and grabbed a spoke on Julies road bike that is hanging from a hook. As I moved away she kept holding on. The bike moved about six inches and then she let it go. It swung back and forth and, smiling broadly, she watched it swing back and forth in amazement. She seemed to be studying the bikes motion. It was a beautiful thing to watch.</p>

<p>Today I also mended a pair of pants that I like and have had for several years. Using <a href="http://askandyaboutclothes.com/Tutorials/KabbazHowToSewOnABUTTON.htm">this tutorial</a> I was able to sew the button on with out tying any knots.The pictures are a little grainy but the instructions are clear. Julie laughed at me because of how long I spent focused on one little button.</p>

            <description>I went up to eldora on Sunday afternoon with Cory. First couple of runs were ok, but then it started to get fun. When you are in the trees and it starts to snow it is the most magical time. Even better than moonrise/moonset.
We made our way to the west side, Corona, and tried a few tree runs. All the way over, riders left, seemed a little rutty so we tried the trees just after the path gets going and they were alot of fun.</description>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why, but they roped them off around 3:00pm. Best ride of this year so far, but that&#8217;s not saying much since I haven&#8217;t gotten up to Berthoud or Mary Jane either.</p>

            <description>I finished up the whole house humidifier wednesday and it is working normally. Julie notices a difference, and i can too. I think it is more noticeable in the morning. Since the humidifier is only on when the fan or heater is on I am running the fan to circulate air in the evenings.
I still need to upload my pictures and put them into a howto post.</description>

            <description>I am trying to read the three Bourne books by Robert Ludlum. I just can&amp;#8217;t seem to get into them. I thought the first book was kinda slow or dull or both. I am about halfway through the second one and it is just dragging on and on while I don&amp;#8217;t really care about any of the characters. I haven&amp;#8217;t ever read anything by Ludlum before but for all the books he sold I expected a better story that this.</description>

I haven&#8217;t ever read anything by Ludlum before but for all the books he sold I expected a better story that this. Perhaps I am influenced by the movies, which I liked. Usually though, I like the books much better thatn the movies, even when the movies are good.</p>

<p>I might have to put them on a shelf and come back to them later, if there is time as I recieved five or six books for christmas and haven&#8217;t read any except for the Bourne series.</p>

            <description>We didn&amp;#8217;t go up to Winterpark this weekend. I tried to make it up to eldora but that didn&amp;#8217;t happen either. We did take Hannah to the zoo. I got the whole house humidifier installed and played some wii after Hannah went to sleep.
We also got a kid carrier for Hannah, a sherpani I think. Hiking this spring should be fun. One way to make sure it happens enough is to put it on my google calander and then send invatations/reminders to other interested parties.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an movement to ban labels on milk. Speaking from an individual consumerist position we have stopped buying milk that is not labeled &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin&#34;&gt;rBST &amp;amp; rBGH&lt;/a&gt; free. This started when my wife and I were thinking about conceiving and has continued now that our daughter is breastfeeding. Why is it important for us to know where our food comes from? In the scientific sense of natural, I would rather drink a product that comes to me the way it has for hundreds of years. Even if, as Monsanto claims, there is no detectable difference between milk produced from rBST/BGH and non-rBST/BGH cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, I want to know how my food got to me, not just what is in it. I think this started when I read the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Food_Nation&#34;&gt;Fast Food Nation.&lt;/a&gt; It is wrong for our government to deny dairy farmers who use non-rBST/BGH cows the ability to differentiate from farmers who utilize the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA&#34; title=&#34;Recombinant Technology&#34;&gt;recombinant technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA&#34; title=&#34;Recombinant Technology&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; After all, the labels are more than just marketing &amp;#8230; they are providing insight into the process used to produce the product; much like how the ingredients list all the substances used to make up the product, it is information relevant to how&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>customers will make their choices. I hope the FDA stays out of it and continues to allow non rBST/BGH milk labels so that it is easy for consumers who care about that where their milk came from and how it was produced can easily differentiate between the two.</p>

<p>If they do remove the labels there is one sure way to make sure you know the milks history, you can find a local dairy that doesn&#8217;t use rBST or other artificial techniques to enhance the cows milk production. We use <a href="http://www.longmontdairy.com/">this dairy farm&#8217;s milk delivery service</a> and have been very happy. I know its weird, but when I drink other milk now I can taste the difference. Plus, they make excellent chocolate milk.</p>

<p>The article I was reading that make me think about why we switched to Longmont Dairy is located <a href="http://alternet.org/workplace/78660/">here.</a></p>]]></content>

            <description>It was snowing today. Not to much, just a few inches but it was cold outside so I decided to go to the Gym. Getting up at 5:15 is no to hard once your body is moving. After quickly going through my weights routine I headed over to the stationary bike. After last Friday it made me feel nostalgic for Ventura County&amp;#8217;s weather.
On a stationary bike I just set the resistance and started peddling.</description>

After last Friday it made me feel nostalgic for Ventura County&#8217;s weather.</p>

<p>On a stationary bike I just set the resistance and started peddling. For variety I will increase the mph&#8217;s every other minute for thirty seconds. so if I am able to easily do 20 mph then i&#8217;ll kick it up to 24 miles per hour for thirty seconds. It does get a bit boring but thats when I engage my imagination. Today I had thoughts of the Guadalesca Trail in Sycamore for a while. Towards the end of my thirty minutes I began thinking about spring coming in Colorado and looking forward to Walker Ranch and Winterpark Riding. WInterpark prolly came up because we are headed up there with some fellow Lilac Circle families for a relaxing weekend of snowboarding.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have fond memories of learning to mountain bike at Sycamore. We visited Newbury Park last weekend so Hannah could get some time with her maternal grandparents and so Julie could see some of her girlfriends in the area. So on Friday afternoon I found myself with several hours to kill. Earlier I sent an email to a Newbury Park bike shop asking about any rental mountain bikes they might have but had not hear back from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my father-in-law has a rigid frame bike that looked like it was capable enough. After fiddling with the gears for a bit, trying to get the full range, i gave up and just made sure I had granny gear since I doubted I would be going full speed over the rough patches. I found an old helmet and off I went. I rode to the Wendy Dr trail head and started down. It was beautiful &amp;#8230; so green and sunny and the temperature was just right at 70. They must have gotten a lot of rain recently. I started on my usual warm up loop and found that they are now letting bikes go on the Hidden Pond trail. This started off good&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have fond memories of learning to mountain bike at Sycamore. We visited Newbury Park last weekend so Hannah could get some time with her maternal grandparents and so Julie could see some of her girlfriends in the area. So on Friday afternoon I found myself with several hours to kill.

<p>Luckily, my father-in-law has a rigid frame bike that looked like it was capable enough. After fiddling with the gears for a bit, trying to get the full range, i gave up and just made sure I had granny gear since I doubted I would be going full speed over the rough patches. I found an old helmet and off I went. I rode to the Wendy Dr trail head and started down. It was beautiful &#8230; so green and sunny and the temperature was just right at 70. They must have gotten a lot of rain recently. I started on my usual warm up loop and found that they are now letting bikes go on the Hidden Pond trail. This started off good</p>

<p>but got a bit steep for me, so I ended up hiking some of the top. I veered off Hidden Pond to head back into the main network of trails and ended up on what I used to call the add on loop. This took me back down to Big Sycamore Trail. From there I headed towards Hell Hill, intending to ride it up to the Back Bone Trail the first time and then a second time to do Guadalesca, but I got stopped by the newly opened (to me) Coyote Trail and decided to try it. The bottom was pretty good single track but as I got near the top it got to steep for me. I didn&#8217;t realize that this trail went back over to the paved road near where i picked up the add on loop. Next time I may ride it by going the opposite direction for the technical downhill parts it offered. From here I picked up a trail (Sin Nombre Trail, i think) that intersected the Ranch Center Fire Road and ended up back on Big Sycamore for one last climb up out of the canyon. Great fun for a Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Great trail, but I really missed my 19&#8243; Marin Wolf Ridge and some gloves by the time I got back to the Wendy trail head. Ironically, later that evening as I was gingerly sitting down on a sofa, I checked my email and saw that the <a href="http://npbikeshop.com/" title="Newbury Park Bicycle Shop">Newbury Park Bicycle Shop</a> had emailed me back. Turns out they do rent mountain bikes. Good to know for the next time we take Hannah to visit.</p>

<p>Total ride time was four hours. I uploaded some pictures <a title="Sycamore Cyn Photos" href="http://gallery.mac.com/hippely#100027" target="_blank">here. </a></p>]]></content>
