            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I learned about tools from my dad. He used to fix everything us kiddos broke around the house and the cars and other engine driven things we used. I remember he had a method that included starting from the problem and working backwards through the solution. I spent alot of time bored out of my mind, holding his tools. Sometimes I was sent to get different tools but usually he brought a couple of different general purpose tools and was able to make due with them.</p>

<p>Its funny, the more I learn about software and software development, even from a web slanted view, it all depends on the tools you use. It depends on the tools that work best with your style. I have been keeping my personal projects and org-mode files under version control at bitbucket with mercurial for a few years now and while not completely immersed in the distributed version control environment, I am drawn to the benefits of it. Namely being able to commit to my repo whenever and whereever I am internt access or no internet access.</p>

<p>As I ramp up the search for opportunities in the next phase there are a lot of things I still need</p>

<p>to process but publishing my resume online, branded as me and independent of everything else is the most important thing I need to maintain right now. I have very specific requirements and even more functionality that I am going to add so it makes sense to put it under version control, even if it only starts out at html/css/JavaScript. Since bluehost already has git installed for me to use and, fortuitously, since bitbucket started offering git as an option when creating a new repository, I put the first version in there.</p>

<p>The past few days I have gotten it to the point where I am comfortable publishing it and sending out some requests for feedback on the content and behavior of the layout. You know how it is though, especially with projects that are personal: you always find little things that need tweaked. I found the ease of deployment for a static html site super easy with git. Make a change on my laptop, test it in the different browsers and use the iOS Simulator to take a look at iPad and iPhone browsers. Who knows what someone might use to look at that page when I start using it to market myself. So I make some tweaks, some small, some bigger &#8211; I had to script a few changes for the iPhone because the screen is so small. I commit a series of changes and push a changeset. Then, and this is what I think is great &#8211; I ssh into my bluehost account and change to the online resume directory and all I have to do is git pull. There is no ftp all the files over to the webserver, there is no scp a tarball, delete the old files and unpack the new ones. It is just update the live version and go on about my day.</p>

<p>The importance of tools in helping me is no different than the ones my dad has that he used to build, fix and modify the home I grew up in. The parallells between the real world and the digital world amaze me and the skills I saw Dad use to troubleshoot still apply, even though the tools in play are completely different.</p>
