                <p>This late night Hannah fun is from two days ago. I had my server off for a few days so I am posting it now.

<p>When I write a program i sometime use variables as place holders or counters that will track the progress function that uses looping to do some work for me. Everytime your program goes through the loop you have to tell it to increment the counter variable. If I have a variable named &#8216;counter&#8217; then I can use a shorthand notation to &#8216;increment counter.&#8217; This is done by writitng this: counter++. Now you understand the teeth++ above. The current value of Hannah&#8217;s teeth variable is 3.</p>
