<p>I think thats why I get so frustrated with the ektron system. The two words that come to mind over and over are brittle and cumbersome. Things are easy to break and hard to do. The amount of clicking to find-and-edit or create-new is huge! Having only been in the web/programming business for a few years I am no UI expert; however, I do know an intuitive and well thought out UI when I work with one and WordPress is both, ektron is not. Perhaps thats why Ektron is used in the workplace and WordPress is used to blog for fun.</p>
