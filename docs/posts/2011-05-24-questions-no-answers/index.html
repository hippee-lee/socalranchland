<p>picked up a copy about the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers &#8211; Wow! This is a crazy crazy world. Why is there a link between profoundly creative people and the self destructive patterns many of the most influential artists exhibit? Is the balance between creativity and the behaviors that drive it like a wave that you ride, balancing on top until it crests out &#8211; if your still going when the water recedes you swim back out and try again? Is just showing up enough, or, do you have to kill it every time?</p>

<p>I think this little guy has some questions for us. He kind of looks like a little Ewok hanging from a tree.<figure id="attachment_2310" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></p>
