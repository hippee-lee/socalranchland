<p>The DOM with images was there and now I can make them do what I want. I learned a</p>

<p>bit more about JavaScript along the way and thats always fun too. I also learned that mogrify is a similar to sips on OSX. The images I uploaded were full size and were taking forever to fully load. It was kind of funny to watch partially loaded images cycle around until they were all loaded into the DOM. Anyhow, if you are on linux and need to (quickly) resize a batch of images you can man mogrify or: $ mogrify -resize 800 /path/to/img/*.JPG. I think it is part of imagemagick</p>

<p><strong style="font-style: italic;"></strong>but I am not to familiar with that library.</p>
