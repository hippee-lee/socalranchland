<p>Let&#8217;s get a few thing onto the table. This is not the first time I&#8217;ve had this problem. But, I am the typical white male American from rural enough America who made it well enough off to be able to complain about first world problems. Heck, the fact that I get to complain from my first gen iPad mini is evidence enough to of my entitlement. If you want more evidence of it, how about this:having grown up listening to the Eagles and Credence Clear Water Revival on my factory working fathers hard earned radio, I now have to resort to listening to yelowolf and whining online because the mindless movie I tried to download didn&#8217;t work, again. Queue up the tiny purple violin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The movie I&#8217;m trying to download it for the past few hours will help me disconnect me from the start up I work at and the decidedly first world employment problems I had today. I know, it&#8217;s tragi. Given the fact that my wife is smarter than me. I get paid more than her to fiddle th bits on high rsolutin screns while over zealous police shoot to protect instead of diplomatically serve as diplomat and diffuse the situation. You would think that I would be able to place my &#8216;problems&#8217; into a proper context.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But really, that stuff doesn&#8217;t matter. And I have to say, it&#8217;s your fault. Apple. If only, iff only you already sold that iPad pro I would have bought one and be happily watching the rents movie Jupiter Ascending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I hear you. Sng yea childe of self entitlement. I would have bought the newer device and I am sure that renting a movie would be seemless and easy and just work. Because right now, after the day I had &#8211; first world entitlement and all &#8230; I just want some mindless storytelling to decompress with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must also know that I have had the privilege of a few glasses of whiskey on the rocks (goes great with the yelowolf and &#8216;have a great flight&#8217;) and will unfortunately resort to working on my app that solves all my visualization / system modeling problems and prolly yours too &#8211; all with the interesting Swift language features that I hope you improve next week wrt Xcode. I know, I know. I hear you, first world problems and self entitlement and all of that. We got it on the table already so let&#8217;s lea it there while we talk. Then, you can ignore my whining. No worries I&#8217;ll easily be able to get a refund when get the iTunes recipe in my email inbox.</p>

<p>Worst case, this rental issue keeps happenng until you open that fancy new spaceship of yours and I finally apply to be a code monkey to help you solve this problem. But maybe not, wwdc is next week and I hear that you have a priority on making your software work well on older devices. Maybe, I hope so. Because I just really wants mindless entertainment tonight and it didn&#8217;t just work.&nbsp;</p>
