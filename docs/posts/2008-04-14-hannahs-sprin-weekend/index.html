    content="I think Spring finally broke for good this past weekend. Hannah got to spend lots of time with her maternal grandparents. Paul and Cheryle drove up from Thousand Oaks for a long weekend. They watched Hannah while Julie and I cleaned the garage and patched all the cracks from the mud jacking. While I was turning on the sprinklers, Julie went out to ride Bo. Later that night we got a movie date night out of it while the grandparents put Hannah down to bed. From the &amp;#8216;report&amp;#8217; we got later that night she wasn&amp;#8217;t thrilled about not being put down by a regular (Me or Julie) but she rolled with it and let them calm her down and comfort her to lala land. For our date we went and saw 21, which i thought was ok but nothing special.
On Sunday we got up early and Julie and I ran in the Canine Classic. It was fun, there were a ton of dogs everywhere and the weather was really nice. Not to hot, not too cold, just right for running 5 kilometers. After the race we went into Boulder for brunch and then went home for a nice mid afternoon siesta.

                <p>I think Spring finally broke for good this past weekend. Hannah got to spend lots of time with her maternal grandparents. Paul and Cheryle drove up from Thousand Oaks for a long weekend. They watched Hannah while Julie and I cleaned the garage and patched all the cracks from the mud jacking. While I was turning on the sprinklers, Julie went out to ride Bo. Later that night we got a movie date night out of it while the grandparents put Hannah down to bed. From the &#8216;report&#8217; we got later that night she wasn&#8217;t thrilled about not being put down by a regular (Me or Julie) but she rolled with it and let them calm her down and comfort her to lala land. For our date we went and saw 21, which i thought was ok but nothing special.</p>

<p>On Sunday we got up early and Julie and I ran in the Canine Classic. It was fun, there were a ton of dogs everywhere and the weather was really nice. Not to hot, not too cold, just right for running 5 kilometers. After the race we went into Boulder for brunch and then went home for a nice mid afternoon siesta.</p>

<p>After we got up Julie, Hannah Cheryle and I went out to Bo. I rode for a little bit and got him up to a decent speed for me. After I was done warming him up, Julie rode for a bit too. We were going to try to take a Yoga class at the rec center but they told us the wrong time so I guess we&#8217;ll have to go next week.</p>

<p>Things I want to get done this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit the Easter footage and press a dvd</li>
<li>configure planner : remember : diary : muse</li>
<li>put some sg content into that wp install and find a suitably hackable theme to install</li>
<li>scan in the sign language pics and set up a j/s application to scroll through them like flashcard</li>
<li>seed and fill in the lawn with top soil.</li>
<li>ride the Betasso(sp?) loop on Tuesday and Thursday.</li>
</ul>
