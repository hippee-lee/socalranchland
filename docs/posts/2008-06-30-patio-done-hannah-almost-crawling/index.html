Next time I need to hire a day laborer to help move stuff from the front the back and seriously consider renting one of the hand powered front end loaders to help with moving/loading/excavating.
In Hannah news she is standing like mad (with assistance) and can almost push herself up into a sitting position on her own. I give it a week ands she will be sitting up

<p>on her own. The same goes for crawling. When she is in a sitting position she will see something she wants that is just out of reach and lean forward like she is going to crawl to it but then she seems to think about it and decides to wait just a little bit longer.</p>

<p>It is really time to order some baby proofing stuff. We need the portable baby pens, top and bottom stair gates and cupboard locks to start with.</p>
