      <title>Walking Nashau</title>

      <description>After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.
i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.
I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods.</description>

      <description>We stopped at the outlets on our way home from the lilac circle Breckenridge weekend. Hannah was sound asleep when we got out of the car. I carried her into the first store and she heard the music, opened her eyes and started bobbing her head to the music for a minute. Then she closed her eyes and snuggled back down into my shoulder, fast asleep.</description>

      <description>Vacation week is underway and Hannah is running a fever. This afternoon, she got all snuggly, and then her temp spiked to 104 for a few minutes. 10 long minutes later it was 102 and ten after that it was 100. Forty five minutes later it was normal, mama was home and Hannah was turning around yellng in that todler half speak that she makes up.
I&amp;#8217;m sure traveling will be interesting.</description>

      <description>It was a semi lazy weekend. I did get one project completed though. Here are the fruits of my labor.
We are headed out to Utah tommorow, for turkey day 2008, at about 5am, perhaps earlier if my crazy ðŸ™‚ wife has her way. That should put us in Salt Lake City by mid-afternoon.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/p-640-480-cda7ea7e-d398-44f8-a703-f19e2da283cc.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-364&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/p-640-480-cda7ea7e-d398-44f8-a703-f19e2da283cc.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traveled with Julie and Hannah to the Conejo Valley, she had training for work. Hannah and I hung out with Grandma Cheryle Today. I got a very good nap when Hannah took hers this afternoon, almost two hours. More of the same, I want to ride Sycamore but I have a couple of other things that I want to get done on the computer first so I may just go over there and get a quick trail run in. I have been running alot lately even though I profess to dislike it. I think that is because it is quick, out the door type exercise and convenient. I think I am going to take one of the rock climbing classes at the rec center this winter. Its been years since my harness has been used and I forget the knots and other stuff thats important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather here is really great. It was sunny and 85 today. It was overcast on Wednesday back in Erie but has cleared up even though fall weather has asserted itself in the last few days. Temperatures are only getting to the mid 50&amp;#8217;s or low 60&amp;#8217;s during the day and at night its getting below&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to San Diego this weekend and Hannah had a blast. I think it wore her out a little bit though. She got to meed Scott and Sarah&amp;#8217;s new puppy, Aggie and she got to see her Grandma Cheryle and Grandpa Paul while Julie and I went to a wedding. She had a great time with her grandparents and then On Sunday we took her to the San Diego Cove.</description>
