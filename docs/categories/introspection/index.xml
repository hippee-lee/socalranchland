      <description>It says more about congress than Facebook that the American congress has a childish understanding of computers, networks and algorithms. They are woefully uneducated and inarticulate when it comes to discussing the technical aspects of data and Facebook and how the two impact the social fabric.
Watching senator after senator ask questions that clearly demonstrate this lack of understanding on a fundamental level I&amp;#8217;m left with the question, are they even qualified to bring legislation that will address the social impacts that data collection by corporations has on society?</description>

      <description>I am struggling to get back into my morning routine. Even though I know its good for me its been a struggle for the past few weeks to get up and get going. Part of it is me. I am a creature of habit and routine. Get me off my routine and it seems like everything has fundamentally changed and it takes cycles to get back on.
Maybe telling myself that I will do it is enough.</description>

      <description>I saw this ina stream and wanted to write it down. Marked as a todo in that I want to distill it into a less verbose list of action items.
A team composed of several specialists (doctors, anthropologists, demographers, nutritionists, epidemiologists) – and led by Dan Buettner himself – travelled many times to the different blue zones. They identified the following nine general longevity factors, which are related to diet and lifestyle:</description>

      <description>I need to establish a new routine that lets me make progress on my personal goals.&amp;nbsp;
Every week I need to review and document myself.&amp;nbsp;
First, I need to commit to those nebulous goals that roll around in my head. The things I’ll do someday and the ideas that I can visualize with a hazy lack of clarity but keep floating to the surface.&amp;nbsp;
From the Principles book:
 Have clear goals.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Why do you run from them?&amp;#8221; she asks him. A simple question with an answer like all answers &amp;#8211; more complicated the the deeper you get under the surface of what&amp;#8217;s obvious. The human psyche is a hall full of smoke and mirrors. Even when we choose the right path we are lucky more often than we are right.&amp;nbsp;
The question that he poses back to her is apt enough to catch her attention.</description>

Luddite comes close but its not quite right. I hate that. I hate that some of those comments are from friends and family who are good people and when I engage with them its an unproductive conversation about apples and oranges. But, I hate what the whiney and grumpy old man in the white house did yesterday on many, many levels so I&amp;#8217;m going to make some observations hereFirst about. I hope at the very least you can *try* to understand where I am coming from. &lt;/span&gt;

      <description>Even if its just a suburban ranch its still full of life and lessons and hard work. Surviving is more than just showing up. Thriving is more than waiting for nice pleasant things to show up.&amp;nbsp;
Having a plan. Sticking to it and chipping away at the mou Taib of work are two keys to fulfilling a dream come true on the urban ranch.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>with the #weather and other #fakenews.&amp;nbsp;

I could use some of this flavor of comedy after hearing about all of the fake news this week. The rules have changes for sure.&amp;nbsp;
It seems like they are the same as last time around. Same as they always are.&amp;nbsp;
 It starts with me and I don&amp;#8217;t take critique well. I struggle with shutting my mouth long enough for the rational part of my brain to separate the intel I have been given from the emotional response that desperately wants to leap from my mouth.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve found that I think&amp;nbsp;I know things and even more dangerous, I think I do &amp;nbsp;things. Like read something that makes sense and make sure it&amp;#8217;s legit. Or when someone says a numerical figure in conversation it I go verify it.&amp;nbsp;
I heard a podcast a whole back and it was about an issue with per reviewed research. The gist of it was that most research only gets done once because the grant money is in novel research.</description>

      <description>I am testing myself on some personal learning topics and here are my Q &amp;amp; A&amp;#8217;s. Underlined words indicate an area I need to investigate and understand better. Study was mainly done here
WHAT IS TREE TRAVERSAL? Tree traversal in this context is the programmatic visitation to nodes in a tree. In my mind is a BST with data and left and right pointers. The process that a program uses to visit and perform computation on the trees nodes is tree traversal.</description>

      <description>I have always loved good music. I&amp;#8217;ve heard some good songs of this time and I still love it when I come across timeless lyrics like this:
 Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
pour another glass of that rock and roll
 I&amp;#8217;m a long way from the mid 90&amp;#8217;s Cleveland metal scene. &amp;nbsp;Boy! Man o man did it train my ear to find the good sounds in the sonically oversaturated internet world of 2015.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web is an infinite canvas. Anyone can create a page with a bit of html and even make it look nice with some css. Word processors are infinite canvases &amp;#8211; just open up a new page and you can write whatever you want to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoid The Hard Line</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to take a stand. You feel that you have no choice but to &amp;#8216;draw a line in the sand.&amp;#8217; This line is a dangerous thing. As with all things of last resort it can inflict as much damage on yourself as it can those whom you are trying to protect yourself from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall  when Gandalf broke the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers&#34;&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/a&gt;, it did not end well for him. But he saved his friends and things worked out. I like this, its ideal but if I have learned anything these past years is that the &lt;strong&gt;real world and the ideal one inside my head have very little in common. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A whiskey infused customer support request to try and get iTunes movie rentals to work on my aging iPad mini mini. &amp;nbsp;-MattH
 Let&amp;#8217;s get a few thing onto the table. This is not the first time I&amp;#8217;ve had this problem. But, I am the typical white male American from rural enough America who made it well enough off to be able to complain about first world problems. Heck, the fact that I get to complain from my first gen iPad mini is evidence enough to of my entitlement.</description>

      <description>Here is an odd turn of events. I have been saving for a nice pair of headphones (Shure 535&amp;#8217;s) and decided to get a mini amp (Fiio &amp;#8211; Mont Blanc) since phone&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t have the power to do them justice.
The amp is nicely crafted with brushed aluminum for its enclosure. To turn it on and control volume there is a knob with a rough but pleasant to touch texture. It has a satisfying click and I find myself envying the control over volume more than with the rockers on the phones that I have used since as long as my memory goes back for that kind of thing.</description>

      <description>I believe that we all have ideas. Some good, some different and some that are meh. Together we can assemble ideas that can solve the biggest of problems. These pieces of the puzzle are more difficult to mine than diamonds and gold but are infinitely more valuable when we put them together in a variety of ways with other ideas from like minded folks.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a weird layout issue with the Bootstrap 3 Grid this morning. After three attempts that ended in failure, on way or the other I was something. Frustrated, pissed, annoyed are words that come close to the feeling, but they are not quite right. English is a funny language and sometimes not quite descriptive enough for the more subtle emotions that wash over you from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a break. On the Twitter I saw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/the-quitter&#34;&gt;Virgin twitter feed post&lt;/a&gt; to this. It helped 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Early morning thought for more exploration at some point:
Go right up to the line. Study it, learn about its history and why its where it is at that moment. Then, press your index finger up against it and see how it responds. Is it stretchy and membrane like? is it porous or brittle? Does it deliver an electric shock to your system? You won&amp;#8217;t know if you never try to cross the line.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that some are worried that there is all this really important data hidden in spreadsheets and tied to an app and an OS. And that data may not be parsible in fifty or a hundred years. And that may be so. But, our knowledge is still passed on in the oral tradition. And now it&amp;#8217;s an easily persists or audio visual tradition. It&amp;#8217;s funny, how the more things change, technology, the more they stay the same, good story telling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The accomplishment of many goals, this is your application or service. Avoid building the service to fit the people using it. Build it and evolve it to fit the accomplishments.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three quotes from the (Audio) book: &lt;a href=&#34;http://makeitstick.net&#34;&gt;Make It Stick:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourages deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its better to attempt a solution and supply an incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.&lt;/li&gt;

 My favorite part of the story was when the reindeer nudged Teeka on the cheek. This was my favorite part of the story, because I would like to have a nudge from a reindeer. If I were Teeka, I would be really nice to the reindeer all the time. If I were one of the reindeer I would listen to Teeka all the time.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Is a book about recent advances in understanding the science of learning and questions some of the assumptions you may have. This stands out since I seem to have started 2015 off with an understanding and using failure theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful learners who interpret failure to learn something as the result of insufficient effort or an ineffective strategy will more often dig deeper by asking more questions and using what the learn to try different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

Failure as in, &amp;#8216;define my success by the things I have failed trying to do.&amp;#8217;
Failure as in, &amp;#8216;if I have not failed at something today, then I&amp;#8217;m not challenging myself.&amp;#8217;
Failure as is, &amp;#8216;we grow and learn the most when we struggle and fail to easily succeed at something.&amp;#8217;
Forget failing fast. Just try many things and plan to fail at most of them.</description>

 Question:
Would you rather fly or drive across the country?
Answer:
Drive &amp;#8211; its more scenic, less stressful than airports and only has the con of needing to make personal time to do it.</description>

 What, you think because you&amp;#8217;re paying Apple that you&amp;#8217;re somehow in alignment with them?
 Despite the admiration that has grown on me wrt how Facebook is lead and some of the things they are doing, my opinion of a company built solely around advertising is not based on how I think I align with them. It&amp;#8217;s how I think they align with me.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t know who said it when I was growing up, but, it has held true for me as I walk along this path.  “Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.”  There are many places that it could have come from. See here for more info.</description>

      <description>Most people think nothing of creating and leaving their digital assets with third parties. This is wrong because it robs their legacy and their grandchildren&amp;#8217;s grandchildren from seeing a full picture of their true self and the life they live.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fun sidewalk chalk with my little art director. It was a tale of two cities, Poky &amp;amp; Glossly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glossly was an urbanized mecca for billions of hipster rolly pollies. Poky was a little town where life balance is in harmony with the natural state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asking the wrong question is expensive. It eats up time, creates unintended problems with cascading consequences and exhausts your energy. We are looking at appetizing our themes at work. Our themes are simple angular apps that depend on a toolbox of things related to the api, business logic and the desire to provide some out of the box components that just work. For the uninitiated Angular developer this lets them focus on the style and presentation of the app and spend time where they are more comfortable, with the scss (or css if they nee to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest digital virus going around the internets caught up with me this past weekend and team Mack tagged me as one of their &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; So, I had my lovely assistant help me with the challenge and with her advice I pass it on to Barbi, Jasmine and Raquelle. Good thing it was warm and pleasant here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy cold showers but this was more like a polar bear swim. I think Hannah enjoyed pouring the H2O over my head though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs on problem solving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don’t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it’s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s sort of the middle, and that’s where most people stop… But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem — and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolutionary gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary keeps you moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what, you think different. So does everyone else. If we all think different, all the time there will be billions of little revolutions that spark, flare up and flame out. The flare ups that evolve into consuming a fuel source are the ones that change everything. They transform the landscape as they go through their lifecycle. Everything has a lifecycle: businesses, ideas and organisms alike. &amp;#8220;Whatever it is, we all go through it&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latyrx&#34;&gt;Latyrix&lt;/a&gt; (I think)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Focus, and stay perfectly still.
Focus, calm your mind.
Rest your body. And go to sleep. A smile does wonders for the reception of my delivery.  Lay down still.
Close your eyes, and rest.
Your mind. Sleep.</description>

&lt;p&gt;No, not this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping&#34;&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt;. Well not at the technical level I would expect to find myself at. It strikes me as odd that this is not more urgent for me. We have all the tools to, whats the phrase, turn the tables? Close, but not quite right. While fully acknowledging the inherit risks we should embrace the ability of our devices to track stuff. We can use it to our advantage, with a little help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The answer we seek is not always obvious. As we grow and gain experience we become skilled in sussing out the easy answers. But what about when it&amp;#8217;s hard? When the path is not as well traveled?
Walk on soldier. Persevere and gain the victors spoils for they are well worth the price you must pay.
 &amp;#8230;the willingness to explore the least likely pathways is important for often there can be no other reason for exploring such pathways.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are giving our gold away with the sand and pebbles as we watch the breadcrumbs of our digital lives float down the river of life. We need a sieve and nets that we control. Who cares what they do. Clearly it&amp;#8217;s not illegal and the shareholders seem happy, if fickle. What those folks do does not concern me. What you do does. You have already given it all away, take some back for yourself. For your future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to program, learn how to break shit first. Some tools (git) make it easy to break. Eventually, once you break enough shit, someone who knows you can break will challenge you. Challenge you to fix something that someone else broke or address a problem that has never been solved but holds them back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had neglected the editor setup on my personal laptop for a while. The only thing that was even close was emacs because I really like org-mode as catch all for things that I want to version control and drag around with me. At work I had started to really like Sublime Text 2 but didn&amp;#8217;t know until after I bought it that it was going away and the license doesn&amp;#8217;t count for ST3. Oh well, I can live with ST2 until it dies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zumbox is winding down and I&amp;#8217;m iterating through updated versions of my resume and cover letter. I&amp;#8217;ve been testing the water around TO this week and there are opportunities for sure. Doing the new browser client in AngularJS was very fortuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to take an Angular path to some more JS enlightenment* &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-My-Experience-With-AngularJS-The-Super-heroic-JavaScript-MVW-Framework.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s highs for me were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope, $scope and direct binding to the DOM elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directives as reusable widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory services with the builder pattern for extending an objects functionlity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaYaaq2Miw&#34;&gt;Promises, Promises&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://taoofcode.net/promise-anti-patterns/&#34;&gt;Promise Anti-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still going up (and down 🙂 ) &amp;#8211; every time I drop into the angular source code to trace or debug issues I am treated to a mind expanding experience. And it&amp;#8217;s very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Design A Tall (JavaScript) Function</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-design-a-tall-javascript-function&#34;&gt;How to design a (tall JavaScript) function:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&#34;&gt;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching the video for &amp;#8220;Design a function to determine if an image is tall.&amp;#8221; and using the tall-starter.rkt in DrRacket. As an exercise I transposed it into JavaScript with the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must get a working prototype as fast as possible (10 minutes or less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it my own ad hoc way since jasmine/karma/protractor are libraries/frameworks and not native to browsers
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not base the measurement of myself on the number of times that I have fallen. I measure myself on two things: what was I doing when I fell and how did I get up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Procreate more and more. It is steadily replacing Paper by 53 as my go to app to sketch, mock or doodle. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s the weird tone the support staff takes in papers forums (and the sad we&amp;#8217;re just like Apple and we know what&amp;#8217;s best for you attitude; without even knowing why Apple can get away with it and they can&amp;#8217;t) or the Pro part of Procreate: a free downloadable book for the manual, layers and I can import things into the app to draw on top of.</description>

      <description>A post from a notebook that I kept :
&amp;nbsp;
There is no such thing as comfortable.
Success is:
 Self contained Focus Conviction Hardcore with a twist of funk Handstands Trust no one &amp;#8211; Hey, why should I? Trust is earned. Not being a scapegoat. Ever. For yourself, your failures or someone else&amp;#8217;s.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I was thinking back then but I was listening to a lot of Mushroomhead (Carefule here unless you still really like metal, I stopped following them so close around 2004) and Unified Culture at the time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything is tied to a cycle, a rhythm and the beat of someones drum. Things pulse and we are drawn to them in unison. Be it music, be it it code (hardware &amp;amp; software) be it a summer festival in the sun. We are all drawn to the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, music is the light and  I&amp;#8217;m just a fan of anything good. I grew up in northeastern Ohio with the heavy metal hard rock that was really, really fun in the nineties along the Cuyahoga River. Then, Lake Erie and the flats were a great place to experience music and pure Rock &amp;amp; Roll. And then Lallapalooza &amp;#8217;91 came into town and blew my mind. It expand all of the possibilities to the next level that led me to where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Those Old Shoes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sent this into &lt;a href=&#34;https://uncommon.cc&#34;&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;. They ask nice questions. Here is my answer to this one: **Is there something you&amp;#8217;ve lost that you&amp;#8217;ve never forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was three, maybe four years old in northeastern Ohio on an autumn afternoon. My parents made us rake up the leaves one afternoon. It was one of those magical afternoons. Where the sunlight filters down through the mature forest and motes of dust hang between oaks, silver maples and beech trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my shoes off, like I still do. There is nothing like the feeling of green grass and crunchy leaves underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is about tools. Not the scary old dude at the Katie Perry concert by himself or the harmoniously awesome band. My tools. The same ones you might use if you decide to make something similar things that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, about a year ago I started down a new path. I thought it was the same old path I had ridden a thousand times before. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t. It was different. The opportunity was different and I knew that by the time the interview ended and they had had good, thoughtful answers for most of my questions. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next user interface will combine motion with action. Most of the &amp;#8216;action&amp;#8217; will be spoken in the way an executive gives orders to the minions. Copy this, save that and put the other thing over there, oh yeah, when I finish this, remind me to do the other thing before I get distracted by shinty Internet things. All desired actions will  be spoken aloud in conversation. You know people like me whom in the middle of a problem talk it through. Yeah, these additions to ourinterface will be great for us. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I sometimes use my site as a file transfer mechanism. It&amp;#8217;s easier or email services do silly things and make it hard to transfer files in an easy way. I don&amp;#8217;t use dropbox and googles drive is more cumbersome than $scp filename.zip to my hose. With my ssh keys in place its trivial to put the file where I need it to go.
I schedule an automated backup script to backup my site and its databases every month.</description>

      <description>They say that its the little things that kill. The straw that breaks the camels back.
Conversely it is the little things the make large efforts worthwhile. A hand on your shoulder and a word of encouragement; a well timed challenge to make it keep going, The power we have in our every day lives to influence begins and depends on the little things we do. I see this as a father.</description>

      <description>I worked on a project with Hannah this week. We had to design and implement a Leprechaun trap that she could assemble at school. We were constrained to using materials found at home and that could be assembled at school.
We had two designs. The first, using an empty tissue box, was inspired by the raccoon traps in the book &amp;#8216;Where the Red Fern Grows.&amp;#8217; The trapping idea was that we would put something shiny in it.</description>

When we moved I found a bunch of journal entries I made over the years. It&amp;#8217;s interesting. There is a lot of silly things. Although I&amp;#8217;m putting this online in 2012, I&amp;#8217;m putting the original publish date when it was written.</description>

      <description>Teaching Hannah how to run her iPod touch was easy, I just had to play with the settings and shines noises. Then when I take a picture of it, she tells me to wait. And she asks me how to resign the keyboard from the screen.
So when she steps on her first digital stones and wants to move them around, i can only smile and agree.</description>

Just the bare skeleton for now. Thats easy and I can do it in a few minutes with AM coffee. WHile I still like the old theme, it was purchased from ThemeForest over two years ago and it is showing its age in web years.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not the algorithmic kind, the real kind. The kind of sorting that was around long before even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism&#34;&gt;first computer&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, perhaps I had some coins. Coins used to be a popular way to facilitate exchanges. So there we were back when this ancient computer was built. But we didn&amp;#8217;t care about  the computer. I had coins, you had beans, lets talk and make an exchange. Being competitive, I wanted as many of your beans for as few of my coins as possible. And thats where sorting comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>She was born in the California desert and we first met her on our way to Vegas. She was sweet and wiggled alot and had the most beautiful golden colored eyes I ever did see.
She made the trip to Colorado in ought six and then back again this spring. Bouncy and always full of life, even when she was being a little bitchy or taunting horses and cows in the pasture.</description>

      <description>I came across PadMapper.com on Hacker News and being in the market took a look. I liked what I saw, being in the market there is not much to like about the real estate industry. From the way they federate their data and make it as hard as possible for their customers to find what they are looking for, to the cumbersome option selection they provide.
What I liked about PadMappers UI is this:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I friend has been talking about how he wants to use gameification at his employer. One Saturday morning, over coffee I logged into &lt;a href=&#34;http://duolingo.com&#34;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;.com and showed him their interface and demonstrated the elements of gamification in it. Since then they have made several notable enhancements. The most notible technique they use is the owl, Duo. He?She? is pretty cute and expressive enough in response to what I do on the site that I feel something as I interact with the software. When I get busy and the two practice sessions build up I feel guilty because Duo will cry. Ok, not that guilty but enough that I will consciously decide to make time to at least crank through the practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the levels that one can earn by doing lessons and translating real websites. So I can level up and as time has gone on I can follow others and see how I compare &amp;#8211; not in a competitive way but in a &amp;#8220;Wow, how did they get that many points?&amp;#8221; motivational way. Recently I noticed that they enhanced the translating the real web interface so that I can earn more or less points depending on how difficult the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I set up The Openphoto Project on my localhost this morning and kept a few notes:
You don&amp;#8217;t need to have aws accounts, you can use the file system but you don&amp;#8217;t know this until you start going through the site setup after the software, db and web server are nicely talking. In my case I got an answer on the irc channel.
Once I got the software, db and webserver configured and running I navigated through the setup steps and ran into the following:</description>

      <title>Biggest iOS Improvement</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2012-03-12-biggest-ios-improvement/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that the updated messaging get a lot of press after the last iOS update. And it is good, from what I have seen Julie do with it. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to wait a bit longer to get some more experience with it when the iPhone 5 comes out. While I still think the webOS did notifications much better they improved it too. If they could only figure out a way to get webOS notifications and something close to the synergy sync that made contact management so painless on webOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this ins&amp;#8217;t about any of that, it is the biggest thing. On the coolness factoer scale the touchstone was by far the coolest thing, not just because of the nice magnet charging base. I think the wireless sync that the last iOS upgrade included is on par with that. Hannah got a new Barbie movie on DVD last weekend. So I ripped it on my laptop and transfered the file over to the mini hooked up to the tv that is used to sync the iOS devices of my to lovely ladies. Once it was on there and copied into Julies iTUnes library it was trivial to push&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying to sleep in the other day. Usually, up and at &amp;#8217;em by 6:30 I was stalling. I think it was related to the time change. I have never been a fan of it and it throws everything off for a few days. Even Hannah was up later than usual. I wanted to lay still for a while longer and read some more of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s funny how unconnected things can link together in related ways. Yesterday&amp;#8217;s trip to the Butterfly Pavilion and the free kit in cellophane that Hannah got, kinderart projects and learning about animals and bugs combined witha bit of parental laziness and desire for just a few more minutes of morning quiet time lying still unexpectedly gave me a great present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lie still for a few more moments, we had to convince Hannah to be a bit more autonomous. The easiest way to do this is with the iPad because it is bigger than her touch and the games are more fun on it. &amp;#8220;Hannah, do you want to take the iPad and Whitney into your room for a little while longer?&amp;#8221; When she is not asking me to make pancakes, she&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have come across several neat JavaScript programs that take advantage of all the CSS3 fun you can do in modern browsers. Each time I see a new one idas go racing through my head. I can do this or that or &amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I got one of those mailer brochures from a credit card company with pretty images and pithy tag lines telling me all about their product. I don&amp;#8217;t need any more credit cards right now. But it did get me thinking, how could I do this on a webpage? So I marked it up with one of Hannah&amp;#8217;s pens into some simple markup for the different pieces on each page and put it on my desk. Then I cleaned the office and tossed it. However, the idea continued to roll around in my head and about a week later I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thestartupofyou.com/&#34;&gt;The Start Up Of You&lt;/a&gt;. I joined the group on LinkedIn. Why not, I have been spending quite a bit of time on there looking for reasonable jobs lately. So it was easy to join and nice to come across variations of ideas in the book as well as intelligent discussion about how to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit here and try to see what it is that I want I see hazy unfocused shapes moving around in a milky white fog. What is it I need to do and how do I want to get that done? There is more than just the gears behind the clock face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes quite a bit of time to put the shortest bit of delight together. Delight that is fleeting only because of the amount of thought and attention to detail that went into it. Take &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/julie/vday&#34;&gt;cards&lt;/a&gt; for example. No matter where they are found there is far more time in preparing them for consumption that the actual consumption which could only be a few seconds. They comunicate ideas and emotions simply (at least my favorite ones do) and they do it with extreme efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the last card you gave. Most likely, you picked it up at a store, signed your name to it and sent it on its way. Perhaps you took the time to write a more personal note. All of the hard stuff was done for you: which card stock to use, how many colors to use in the graphic design on the front in inside,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Good Choice To Lose</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I had some issues that affected my productivity with google applications in Chrome I re-configured my system to use native apps for chat, mail and calendar. Overall I like the changes and the trade off is worth it since I do not have to log into my google account 30 times a day. I miss using one browser (especially with the three finger swipe down that shows me all of my tabs) but I still use it for development and other browsing. Seriously I counted the last day and it was 30 times google asked me to log in in chrome so I don&amp;#8217;t mind having all my apps in one place. Oddly, firefox and safari do not have this incessant logging in to google services issue with google services. Weird, I know. But I think I&amp;#8217;ll stick with Safari for my work apps accounts for now and use the native apps with personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my point. I was restoring some music to my itunes library and when I dragged and dropped it onto the itunes application I noticed that instead of asking me to choose and drag to Music or Movies, etc; it just highlighted the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoid Fandango</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my second experience with Fandango I like them even worse. We won&amp;#8217;t focus on the lack of usability on their website but to say that it was less than optimal and more than painful to get the information I was trying to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this sub par experience with them is the Google Offers (I&amp;#8217;m not sold on the whole internet coupons as a value proposition for myself either but Julie is a bit more trusting than I am) Fandango tickets we purchased and can&amp;#8217;t use because they are expiring before we can use them at a different theater later this week. We already made plans to meet other folks at a specific theater but unfortunately for us crapdango tells me that &lt;strong&gt;Online Ticketing Not Available for this Theater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh, so let me get this straight, they sell movie tickets but when I want to buy them they can&amp;#8217;t sell them to me. I recall the first time I balked because they tried to force me to register for an account and charge me an extra couple of dollars for tickets. I guess I&amp;#8217;m at a loss to the value they provide. I have never had a hard time getting tickets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have been struggling with the default install of ffmpeg on centOS5 and went to HandbrakeCLI for easy conversion. However, we need a tool that will convert videos for web (this means x264 and other formats for chrome) and iOS devices.
The stock yum install of ffmpeg on centos (i386) is at 0.6ish. I think its time to upgrade our servers because trying to create webm video is just not working.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was Hannahs first day in the PreK class at primrose. Complete with new jumper uniform and excitement that bounced &amp;#8211; she grows up one milestone at a time and all to fast. When she tries my patience and wants to &amp;#8216;play games&amp;#8217; at 5:15 in the morning it helps me to remember that she won&amp;#8217;t always want me to play with her and these opportunities are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, Julie was trying to take a picture of her but Hannah was being camera shy. I know she missed the cutoff date because of her birthday but something tells me that it is going to be up to me and Julie to keep her interested in learning the things that spark her creativity and interests. With the realization that there is never a good time to raise taxes but the general public doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to understand that you get what you pay for. If we cut budgets and funding for teachers and education we will get what we pay for. While I can vote for things like Colorado&amp;#8217;s prop 103 because I believe in it there isn&amp;#8217;t much I can do to help increase funding for schools.

We decorated yet another pumpkin &amp;#8230; I think we should make seeds but have yet to google a good process for cleaning and roasting the seeds. We hit the jumpy spiderman bounce house and talked to some nice people from the neighborhood. Then, some of Hannahs other lilac circle friends showed up and she helped them decorate.</description>

I like that her favorite number is 1. Mine are in no particular order: 11, 19 and 29.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight Hannah and I did LiteBrite instead of reading books for night nights. She sometimes does that &amp;#8230; &amp;#8216;Papa, can we play a game instead of read books tonight?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the drama classes kicked in and she got upset at me. I make deals with her. Tonight the deal was for her to wait in bed for me to come back with my guitar and play her a song after I went to brush my teeth and do shot shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little bunny did not stay in her bed and the deal was off. This was upsetting and I understand. I also understand that we don&amp;#8217;t always get what we want. I think it&amp;#8217;s my job as a parent to teach Hannah that but I&amp;#8217;m not sure. They forgot the manual when were came home with her four years ago. I think that its not just teaching her that we don&amp;#8217;t always get what we want but that when a decision has been made there isn&amp;#8217;t much use crying over it. Has anyone ever been able to teach this to a four year old girl? I don&amp;#8217;t know, me I&amp;#8217;ll just keep chipping away at her subconscious. I know that I&amp;#8217;ll be&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My news consumption has changed since I began using a real smart phone circa 2007. I just seem to read more news sites on that. It might be related to the sites I get news from. They usually link to short fluff type pieces and they are easy to consume without much thought or much time invested. However, I also run into the situation where I find a meatier post &amp;#8211; something technical, something political, something educational.</description>

      <description>A minor rant on the inability of large companies to meet my needs. I understand that they do everything for the average customer and that really means the numbers that the MBA&amp;#8217;s and finance geeks tell them are important. There is no real person who is the average home depot customer and that means the individuals get passed over in the end. Thats fine, I understand that they have to keep the shareholdes happy.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was clean up day and investigate day. I started off with getting the murano&amp;#8217;s tires rotated and then brought it back home for closer inspection of the pads and rotors. They all looked ok. there was a hard to notice groove or ridge in the driver side rear rotor but hard to notice. I&amp;#8217;m not sure whats making the sound but I did notice that the front driver side shock seems to (slowly) be leaking something or something is leaking from above it. The bottom half of the boot was trashed so I removed it and it now matches the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did some watering and planted the grasses on the west side of the deck. They are supposed to grow 3-5 feet wide and 6-8 feet tall. We shall see how they do onec the roots veture out of the topsoil I placed them in. The only thing left to complete my summer project is to buy one large wall block and 2-4 toppers. Then I can rent a saw and make the cuts so that the toppers do not have gaps in them and the ends are flush and can be used as steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a hunter walking in&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just re-read what I put on the two pages bookending the &amp;#8220;Think Big&amp;#8221; two page spread in the in5 book. If I am not going to DO, why do I show up? To put it into a perspective that I have, lets talk riding. Riding anything, everything. I hope you like to ride as much as I do or at least have a passion for something that takes a mastery of your mind and your body in concert. For me thats where the soul lives. In the best rides, the lines that are the most fun are also the most challenging. Those are the sessions that force me to be &lt;em&gt;in the moment&lt;/em&gt; and I don&amp;#8217;t think. Once the trail is behind me I&amp;#8217;ll usually say to myself, &amp;#8220;Wow! That was fun.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it fun? That is the most important thing. Are the problems that you solve fun? If not, why do you wait for it to be fun &amp;#8211; make up a game for one. The volvo repair shop wants $850 to put in a new alternator and I can get it the same day. I would rather find something else to do with that money. So car repairs,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Double Edged Swords</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thats what I tell myself. Everything is a double edged sword. If I can&amp;#8217;t find the good I look for the useful. Thats why I find my self ambivalent to the ie ecosystem. That is where I have been hanging out for a few weeks and I have learned a few things about what I&amp;#8217;m used to and what I prefer. So, while its a crappy platform for the web, it&amp;#8217;s also over five years old. I&amp;#8217;ll bet if I tried to understand five year old firefox bugs it would be equally frustrating. What it comes down to is that Mozilla has done a better job of keeping their users up to date with the latest and greatest and while the web has moved on, ie7 has not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, shile running down table-layout: fixed oddness in ie7 I was struck by how much more useable chrome and firebugs tools are. They just feel slow in ie7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first discovered firebug. While really useful when compared to the web developer extension, it was rough around the edges and crashed on me a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whats the difference? Why are Chrome and Firebug so much better for me now? The web&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This morning while I was doing yard work Hannah did some work of her own. She went to the store (for real this time) and packed for camping. Now we are off to the store for some more sprinkler system parts and wood for the garden boxes.
Watching her at play is educational for me. I think my challenge as a parent is to disguise my advice (tips, tricks and my accumulated knowledge) in a way that she will accept it as her own idea.</description>

      <description>&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2421&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;[&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2421&#34; title=&#34;Hannah&#39;s Dragon Story&#34; src=&#34;http://192.241.192.98/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CIMG0246-300x228.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hannah&#39;s Dragon Story&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;228&#34; /&gt;](http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CIMG0246.jpg)&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Hannah&#39;s Dragon Story&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-spirit-of-that-memory-hannah-says&#34;&gt;In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the story forward, I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;The dragon was full and she lay down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post Solo Followup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of reviewing my &amp;#8216;performace&amp;#8217; I hit the big items on my list here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/&#34; title=&#34;The Solo Week&#34;&gt;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t get to climb but everything else got the attention it needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes for the future. Staining is messy. I&amp;#8217;ll need to pressure wash the windows and deck furniture &amp;#8230; the wind blew it everywhere. The wood looks good though and i&amp;#8217;ll touch up on a cool day this fall. The Wall is built but I need one more big block and then three or four more toppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No pictures, I think I may switch to Google+ picture albums and just link to them here. A social network is not really the place for these kinds of posts but the picture manager I am using isn&amp;#8217;t as slick as the plus picture interface. Speaking of plus &amp;#8211; the coolest thing was supper easy. I got an email notification from the Erie, CO website for a police alert. It seems that 7 homes were bergled over the weekend and it was quick and easy to share that and target only the people who would be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, what I like, is a well thought out UI/UX. From looking at things that break&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Solo Week</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%wppa%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=4%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about someone who decides the day before what The Most Important Thing is for the next day. Then, as part of their routine they spend an uninterrupted 90 minutes working on that Thing. Sounds like a good idea. I am a create of habit and routine &amp;#8211; I like the balance it provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah are heading up to McMinnville next week during Amgen&amp;#8217;s summer shutdown for a week off. I&amp;#8217;m not sure but I think I might be the one getting a week off 🙂 Shhhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to pseudo plan my solo week routine I have a list of the most Important Things that will need my attention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily walks or rides around with the dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ride -&amp;gt; WP&amp;#8217;s bike park is open and the new Valmont bike park needs to be scouted out for fun and to plan future trips with Hannah and perhaps Julie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb. It&amp;#8217;s much more fun than lifting weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build The Wall. I think the arc needs to go around to the fence post and then I can step down 3.5 or 4 steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Stain Pergola. Didn&amp;#8217;t get to last fall or spring &amp;#8230; &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug AMEX about the claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the Important Things are really just routines that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This past weekend, I read a blog post that talked about a data type for &amp;#8216;me.&amp;#8217; The argument premise is that blogs are nice and all but they don&amp;#8217;t capture everything. They only capture a pseudo linear timeline of my output. However the data in my output is more than just what I am thing or recording on a blog. It includes emails, social media things and stuff on my computers that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a happy home upon a cloud anywhere.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can I create an interface if everyone is different &amp;#8211; does things in different ways, prefers their favorite flavors which are different from mine &amp;#8230; has a different emotional reaction than I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously this seems to have been handled with convention and the law of mass average, The law of mass average is my understanding that if you put a jar full of jellybeans out and ask people to guess the number almost everyone will be wrong. If you average the guesses from everyone you will be very close to the correct answer. This is what convention is. Everyone gets together when they use the same service and interacts with it differently. They buy the same product and react to it on different levels and then give feedback to the provider. It&amp;#8217;s minimal, but even no feedback is feedback for the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m starting The Dark Tower again. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how many times, but I&amp;#8217;ve read the first four books more then ten times now, a bit less for the last three though. I first line is epic in scale: (&amp;#8220;The man in black fled west and the gunslinger followed&amp;#8221;). -Note I need to verify the accuracy of my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-05-18-pura-vida/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first Internet access in almost a week. Pura Vida seems to be local slang for &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s all good&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no worries.&amp;#8221; For sure that can describe the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monteverde was lush &amp;#8211; the biodiversity is amazing. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to re-read EO Wilsons book &amp;#8220;The Diversity of Life&amp;#8221; again because it was about places like this. We spent a day in the national park and our guide was very knowledgable of the flora and fauna. She especially liked birds. Besides the forest I saw signs of mountain biking in the area and would be very excited to come back and ride here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a too short stay in our almost private resort we drove down the coast to Manuel Antonio and went diving yesterday. Despite the murky visibility we saw a lot ot wildlife. Today the plan is to hike the national park here and end up at the beach. Hannah has gotten a lot of pool time but only a little beach time so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten some really good pictures but I can&amp;#8217;t post them yet. I&amp;#8217;m using Julies iPad to post this and besides the annoying typing corrections, it lacks the ability to post&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Your imagination is the preview to life&amp;#8217;s coming attractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never written down my goals and usually [day]dream ideas and things I want to do when I am driving. Thats likely why I am only an average driver and make myself ignore the phone &amp;#8211; there is only so much processing power my brain can do at one time. There are several variations to the same themes in my daydreams &amp;#8211; snowboarding every day, solving interesting and profitable problems, migrating around the world with Julie to see and do fun things and showing Hannah the things I like to do and have found to be useful to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book they say when you write your dreams down they become goals. It isn&amp;#8217;t just writing them down though the most successful people review them on an ongoing basis. Perhaps the problem to be solved is two fold; first, my brain needs something concrete to focus on and second, in order to make progress towards my dreams (which are hazy and and ill defined patterns in my stream of thought) the dream needs to be refined as I understand it better, as I know myself better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mission</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-04-11-mission/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next part asks me to think about and determine my mission statement. Because of how I read I shortened it to mission and substitute focus in several places where that made more sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few inspirational quotes from famous and successful people and the book offers a few suggestions fo refining your own mission. For me that means I need to keep it short and concise &amp;#8211; focused. But I started out pretty verbose, rambling almost as a wrote a few paragraphs about all of my grandiose ideas over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote, my mind wandered and focused on the people who are most important to me. This automatically associated my grand ideas with them and I ended up with lots of details. I deleted the details but retained the association of important people in my life with important things to do with and for them. As I re-worked the text it expanded and contracted and gave clues to the direction I want to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is my mission? I like to be creative. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if I am finding a fun line down the slope or trying to find an easier way to get&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I walked far today. Well, not really far but farther than I usually do. I usually prefer to ride things. Standing is easy, walking is not hard but its harder than standing.
We took the dogs to a creek and Hannah rode in the stroller. I hope she feels better soon.
For my afternoon walk I stayed close in the neighborhood and walked around there for a few hours on a home improvement project.</description>

      <description>I found fun turns today, the picture is below.Between a rock and some pow turns
My turns are funny &amp;#8211; the radius gets biger the faster I go.
It&amp;#8217;s only saturday and I also finished the other mini project I started last night!!! I am very excited to hook up emacs, swank-js and node.js. Still not sure what I am doing but it is pretty cool to be able to proxy a site and develop it in a repl environment.</description>

      <description>Netflix is great. I want them to handle all my media needs.
I tried to watch an episode of Merlin the other day and it didn&amp;#8217;t work. The internets said that Netflix was having issues. Then, a few days later they contact me, acknowledge the issues with an apology and try to make it right.
That transparency makes me happy.</description>

      <description>I count seconds with the unofficial &amp;#8216;one thousand&amp;#8217; standard for timing things. When I say one thousand for a single digit number its roughly equal to a second. I say one thousand a bit faster for anything higher than ten because there are more syllables. The term roughly accurate comes to mind but isn&amp;#8217;t quite right.
Either way the fact that I only counted to fifteen and my new mbp went from off to login screen means that it starts up pretty fast.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The book starts off with a great line:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DECIDE WHATS NEXT IN YOUR LIFE AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO GET IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if strategize is a word but the idea is both powerful and subtle. We always tell each other our greatest wants, if only. Most of my if only&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t require huge amounts of money. More than money they require time and flexibility. Ask a meterologist to predict the next snow storm he can&amp;#8217;t do it, not with high accuracy. He can run the models, know the climate and the different types of weather patterns; but they are wrong more often that they are right because weather is random, truly unpredictable. The storms never hit exactly when they are supposed to, they never have as much or as little as they are supposed to. As in Life. So if i can&amp;#8217;t predict whats next and life is random, how do I get my &amp;#8216;If only&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s convenient for me?&amp;#8217;

      <title>Five Year Goal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am adding a new tag so that I can organize the things I have written down in the book Julie got me for Christmas.The name of the book is &amp;#8220;Five&amp;#8221; by Dan Zadra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through it once to understand it and then again to record my details. Now it&amp;#8217;s time to publish them so I can track my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book itself is a very nicely designed concept book. Through a thoughtful layout and color scheme it presents the tools that anyone has at their disposal to answering the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Where will you be five years from today?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question and answer format is interesting; it forces the reader to focus inward for the answers. And as fond as I am of snowboarding the Vasquez Cirque by myself or gentle morning yoga sessions that focus more on the mind than the body; I do very little inward directed thought to answer questions. Most of questions can be answered with a quick web search. However, for questions like this, there is no way to Google an easy or quick answer. As I went through the exercises the first time one thing became apparent. I have become very dependent on internet search to answer my&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A storm brewing to the west.
Take the scenic route.  It was one of those days, there was traffic on Dillon, more than I expected. It was a good thing; I got to spend more than ten minutes watching the world change as the weather front moved in over the front range.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, my dad would do things around the house, maintain our cars and fix things that could be fixed. As I grew I was often involved in helping him. At first I think I just got in the way, then I was an extra set of hands and later, I was fixing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a conversation we had about his tools where I was really focused on the why Craftsman Tools. Keep in mind this was back in the eighties and I was about 8; I am not sure who the main competitors were to Craftsman but I don&amp;#8217;t recall any brands of tools from back then other than Craftsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know why he used that brand. When we went to Sears, they were way more expensive than anything else I saw. His reply was that they were better and they backed it up. There was a guarantee that I understood as follows: The tools will perform and they will not break or we will replace it. How could they do this, I wondered? He explained to me that they believed in their tools so much that they were willing to replace tools that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If I tell someone that I will call them next week, I should call them. If I don&amp;#8217;t, all I will be is the guy who can&amp;#8217;t keep his word.
Maybe that matters and maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t. If you run in to me down the road before you remember anything else about me, i&amp;#8217;ll bet you remember me as the guy who didn&amp;#8217;t call you back when I said I would.</description>

      <description>As I work through the additions I realized what bothers me about the cms. It gets in the way of my flow. I can&amp;#8217;t just do a bunch of things and then save them. I have to do one thing, wait for the blocking ajax call. I thought the point of ajax was to let the user do other stuff while the service worked in the background.
The system should be able to track where the user was and be able to quickly, )one click) get them back there.</description>

      <description>Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.
Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on leading a meeting</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-01-14-thoughts-on-leading-a-meeting/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-01-14-thoughts-on-leading-a-meeting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been attending many meetings the past year. These are my unofficial guidelines to remember, hopefully they will help you host an effective and productive meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a compelling presentation. While I am not an expert on creating great presentations here are things I would recommend: Be direct with what you want to say, three word phrases or less. Your audience can scan the slide and then focus on you and what you are saying. The same goes for graphics &amp;#8211; make them simple to understand by pretending that you are creating it for the audience reading Time or Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start into the presentation let the audience know that you are going to talk through the slides first and that you will open up/ lead discussion after you are finished talking. This will allow you to present the information you do have in bulk and then, during the discussion you can focus on the feedback your audience is giving back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During your presentation focus on a simple, clear message and use as few words as possible to convey meaningful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan. Depending on the audience, plan your presentation accordingly. If the meeting is an hour long try to condense&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah told me that she pretends to be a little pink monster. She has added &amp;#8216;Scared of Monsters&amp;#8217; to the bed time stalling routine of read books, drink water, go potty, get Whitney &amp;amp; Gurgi, play songs on the guitar and talking.
Tonight we talked about playing in the pool and she was specific about differntiating girls stuff: bandaids, hello kitty and Mommy&amp;#8217;s activities from &amp;#8216;boy stuff&amp;#8217;.
One of the greatest pleasures of bing a parent is the short time between &amp;#8220;The Day&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Asleep.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1217&#34; title=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; alt=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427-300x199.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bella Hunting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I ran throughy the nite time books with Hannah. Her two favorites are the Elmo alphabet book and the color and shapes farm animals book.
Then we said our nite nites. Nite nite list: mama, papa, Gurgi, Whitney, Bella, Bo Bo, mama Rosa, papa Rosa, grandma Cheryle, grandpa Paul, tease, Sierra &amp;#8230;.
Then, after I put her in her crib I did the signs for &amp;#8216;papa love Hannah.</description>

She did great! Going to school is hard, I forgot how much so from the last time. I guess I did it to myself, I could have turned the scholarship down, but then I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have these interesting shell scripting word problems to solve. They make a pretty good puzzle. And this class only goes for a few more weeks.</description>

      <description>When I was a child my mother and grandmother made something called pizza frit. It was really simple but really good. Fried dough rolled in sugar.
When I was in high school I would camp out in the back woods on my parents property and mom would bring us a huge bowl of pizza frit.
I recall this because Julie took me out to Lucile&amp;#8217;s for breakfast and they had pizza frit (they used a different name and powdered sugar instead of granulated but it was the same).</description>

&lt;p&gt;Bella has been missing the last few days. Julie last saw her by Black Rock Elementary on Thursday. We have been letting her out during the day because she gets really crazy when she is confined to the house &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. We though she was gone because we didn&amp;#8217;t have a tag with our numbers on there but I just confirmed that she is at the BVHS (Boulder Valley Humane Society).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dilemma is if we should keep letting her out or not. I am aware of the risks but I wonder if it is crueler to keep her inside all of the time (and crazy) or let her out where she can take her chances and happily goes about her business. I know I would always opt for taking my chances but I am not a cat. Since she is a cat and she can&amp;#8217;t really tell me what she wants, other that to observe her behavior; her behavior tells me that she likes to go outside. I think we will try to find a happy medium: she can still go outside, but only when we are there in the yard. We will also be getting her a tag for her collar&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>That is the main point of this post. I think it also applies to other things besides coding, things I am more familiar with like snowboarding, mountain biking and other real world activities.
When snowboarding if you want to go fast Turn less and just go straight. Depending on your skill level you may want to waer a helmet and try this when no one is around. The same for mountian biking, just brake less but at strategic times.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had Julie give me some feedback on the splash page/dashboard I have been working on. She gave good feedback that I was able to use to refine it a bit. I think she was a little afraid of hurting my feelings though but she shouldn&amp;#8217;t be, we are married after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only pushed out the layout changes and the changes to the latest post. I still need to figure out where the weather widget(s) will go and how they will behave (as tabs or as content areas that dynamically expand when the user is interested in them. I am not sure. I also need to spend some time updating the categories and making sure they are all posted in in the right category. Categories will also need to be changed a bit so that they are all capitalized. The other thing I was going to do with cats is to make several main categories like Outdoors (or Computers, Home, Cars, ) that all of the riding, hiking stuff can go under, then it will rise to the top of the top category&amp;#8217;s script when those links are generated. Maybe I write my ideas down and have my better&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It was a pretty nice day here yesterday. The temp got up to about 60 degrees and thats unusual for this time of the year. I should have been able to leave the pups at home except for Whitney&amp;#8217;s ear. She had a wart like growth on it that needed to be removed so Julie and I performed some minor surgery. The only problem with it is that it was on her ear and head wounds tend to bleed, alot.</description>

      <description>That seems to be all mobile safari can do. I cannot read the news withhout it crashing several times. Does Apple have to many projects to support good quality control?
I am looking forward to the android competition in the marketplace. And will strongly consider one of their offerings next, before buying a second iphone.
It is possible to remove the iTunes drm, so that&amp;#8217;s not a show stopper, the app store still seems buggy and has not impressed me much.</description>

      <description>If we open up offshore drilling we will only increase our domestic oil production by less than 5% by the year 2030. I highly doubt that this will have any impact on gas prices now or then. But, I&amp;#8217;d bet money in vegas that the oil company that does drill there will damage and/or ruin the ecosystem. When have they not damaged or ruined an ecosystem they have had leases in?</description>

      <description>It hot here for the 29th day in a row so I thought I would give the pups a break from the hundred degree days we have been getting in Erie. I brought them into the office and took this picture on one of their breaks outside. It&amp;#8217;s really cool that I can bring them to work with me. I doubt that I could ever do that at companies like Amgen.</description>

      <description>I finished up the whole house humidifier wednesday and it is working normally. Julie notices a difference, and i can too. I think it is more noticeable in the morning. Since the humidifier is only on when the fan or heater is on I am running the fan to circulate air in the evenings.
I still need to upload my pictures and put them into a howto post.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an movement to ban labels on milk. Speaking from an individual consumerist position we have stopped buying milk that is not labeled &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin&#34;&gt;rBST &amp;amp; rBGH&lt;/a&gt; free. This started when my wife and I were thinking about conceiving and has continued now that our daughter is breastfeeding. Why is it important for us to know where our food comes from? In the scientific sense of natural, I would rather drink a product that comes to me the way it has for hundreds of years. Even if, as Monsanto claims, there is no detectable difference between milk produced from rBST/BGH and non-rBST/BGH cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, I want to know how my food got to me, not just what is in it. I think this started when I read the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Food_Nation&#34;&gt;Fast Food Nation.&lt;/a&gt; It is wrong for our government to deny dairy farmers who use non-rBST/BGH cows the ability to differentiate from farmers who utilize the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA&#34; title=&#34;Recombinant Technology&#34;&gt;recombinant technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA&#34; title=&#34;Recombinant Technology&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; After all, the labels are more than just marketing &amp;#8230; they are providing insight into the process used to produce the product; much like how the ingredients list all the substances used to make up the product, it is information relevant to how&lt;/p&gt;</description>
