      <description>I miss riding my mountain bike to work. I am not talking about the crappy bike lane commute into boulder. I miss the ride from the Moorepark trailhead to Amgen in Thousand Oaks.
It took about 45 min, had showers when I got there and I usually had the trail to lonesome.
Time is a luxury that I didn&amp;#8217;t realize I had until I started to run out of it.</description>

      <title>Her Latest Trick</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannahs MOST FUN THING TO DO, lately, has been to pull herself up on something and then let go. She flaps her arms like a bird and tries to balance on two legs. The longest she can balance is for 10 &amp;#8211; 15 seconds. She is also starting to look at other objects that she can balance on and edge her self close to them. I can see her thinking, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll bet I can run to that before I fall!&amp;#8221; A little birdie is telling me that she will be walking before to long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also started saying &amp;#8220;OH!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is after we tell her &amp;#8220;NO!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its kinda funny. We are still workign on some basic signs with her: Eat, More, No, gentle Mamma and Pappa. Nothing back yet but I think she might be starting to get the communicaiton thing. She is sleeping well. What is working now is that she will go down with Julie around 8:30 &amp;#8211; 9:00 and then I&amp;#8217;ll take her into her crib when I come to bed, later. For the last few days she has been sleeping through the night until about 5:45am or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged about 120 miles last week, mostly on the AM&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Loneliness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh Hannah, you were so lonely last night. It broke my heart when I went into your room and you were sitting there looking at the little turtle lights and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I got the diaper situation in line and then rocked you back to sleep. It took a few position changes on your part, but we got you comfortable. Then, after you fell asleep, I held you a little longer so I could listen to the tiny snore that was coming from your cute little button nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little kiddo is getting bigger, but not so big just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really not a fan of riding a bike on the road, even commuter riding. Although, i was thinking today when I rode in that if I could ride three days a week that would save almost 120 miles of driving per week or:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6000 miles per year (assuming my company keeps us at only two weeks of vacation a year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 less fill ups for the Murano&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1350 less on gas per year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a lower resting heart rate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I saw five or six bannan peels on the side of the road when I was riding in, today they were all gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Huffing Tailpipe to Work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode into work today to get some extra riding in. Its weird, but when it is colder the air seems fresher or something. This morning and there was lots of tailpipe to smoke. To bad that&amp;#8217;s not what I like to smoke. Anyways, ride stats are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Distance &amp;#8211; 37.52 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Time &amp;#8211; 2:10:39 hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average Speed &amp;#8211; 17.23 mph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Speed &amp;#8211; 35.80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I think I&amp;#8217;ll get up a little early and try to get over 60 miles in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news: I went in to get her at her usual wakeup time of 5:15 and she was sleeping on her Stomach! That&amp;#8217;s huge for little miss &amp;#8216;I do not like to spend any time on my tummy&amp;#8217; ðŸ™‚ She is also able to stand up for a short time if you lean her against the couch. Yay! I am sure she will want to go snowboarding with us next year ðŸ˜‰ Julei and I have started practicing her crawling coordination. What is that you ask? Well let me tell you. We put Hannah on her back and one of us takes the legs while the other takes the arms. Then we alternate each side in a pseudo crawling motion. It&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Friday Ride to Work &amp;#038; Balloons</title>

      <description>I rode to work yesterday. Total ride time was 2:22. Total distance was ~37 miles. If I worked in the loop near Vista Ridge I should be able to make it more than 50 miles. Felt pretty good, I averaged a bit better than 15mph. Will need many more of these before the silverton 50.
We got up early this am and took Hannah to the balloon launch at the VR clubhouse.</description>

      <title>Wet, Cold and Tired</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a cold wet ride in to Boulder. It was about 40 degree when I left Erie and not raining. By the time I got to Lafayette it had started raining and by the time I came into Boulder it was snowing. I wish my truck was running today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Just got back from four days in San Francisco and I found out how hard it is to work and watch Hannah. I think she is getting bored pretty easily now. I noticed that she is happy entertaining herself for a little while, maybe half an hour. Then she wants some attention or different stimulation. In the mornign she would have her naps and play sessions and I could get some stuff done but then she would get fussy. By the time I went out to meet Julie for lunch she would be a bit cranky. Then I would put on the Bjorn and one of her hats (tangent: i got her a really cute reversible green and white / light green and pink flowers hat that straps on below her chin) and out we would go. As soon as we got into the elevator she would start smiling at anyone near&lt;/p&gt;</description>
