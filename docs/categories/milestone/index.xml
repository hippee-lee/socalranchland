  It&amp;#8217;s that time of year again and back to school she goes. I can&amp;#8217;t believe it or perhaps I just don&amp;#8217;t want to. The smiles this morning were so large and full of life I was just happy to be able to watch her go.

&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I do not base the measurement of myself on the number of times that I have fallen. I measure myself on two things: what was I doing when I fell and how did I get up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution is Migration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything evolves. Not quite the same as the Darwinian definition of the word but its a close metaphor. But, in the small, learning and adapting behavior to take advantage of knowledge sense of the word. That&amp;#8217;s why animals, people included, migrate. Birds go where it&amp;#8217;s warmer and the food is easy. People migrate around various web properties because they find value for their time there. Then a new shiny service starts up and they migrate again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was just informed that there is a wiggly tooth in the house.
From what I hear the tooth fairy has increased her rates so I guess I should invest in some iTunes gift cards.</description>

      <description>Letting go is the hardest parental job to do. Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &amp;#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&amp;#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me.</description>

      <title>Where Creativity Starts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying to sleep in the other day. Usually, up and at &amp;#8217;em by 6:30 I was stalling. I think it was related to the time change. I have never been a fan of it and it throws everything off for a few days. Even Hannah was up later than usual. I wanted to lay still for a while longer and read some more of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s funny how unconnected things can link together in related ways. Yesterday&amp;#8217;s trip to the Butterfly Pavilion and the free kit in cellophane that Hannah got, kinderart projects and learning about animals and bugs combined witha bit of parental laziness and desire for just a few more minutes of morning quiet time lying still unexpectedly gave me a great present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lie still for a few more moments, we had to convince Hannah to be a bit more autonomous. The easiest way to do this is with the iPad because it is bigger than her touch and the games are more fun on it. &amp;#8220;Hannah, do you want to take the iPad and Whitney into your room for a little while longer?&amp;#8221; When she is not asking me to make pancakes, she&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the kiddo bench with tape.&lt;/strong&gt; There was an issue with the Ikea bench after four years of heavy use. Hannah informed us that it broke but she didn&amp;#8217;t break it. As a proactive measure though, she fixed it with tape. How creative I think to myself when we had this conversation. And, how awesome to get to witness that comprehension, observe her growth in understanding. Maybe it is just me but the observational apsect of being a parent is fascinating. As for Hannah, she knows tape is sticky and that one can tape things together. The bench needs something sticky to keep it securely on. That makes sense. If I knew what she knows I think I would do the same. Of all the things I ever thought were cool, this is up there as the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decorate the fish tank.&lt;/strong&gt; There was a morning tummy ache yesterday. Julie stayed home with H but still had to do some work stuff. I guess she was on a conference call when Hannah decorated the fish tank. There is tha card we got from John and Lori after Grugi died and some kinderart to start with. I think the fishy&amp;#8217;s will enjoy the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This year Hannah had her Holiday concert. She and her class were organized and on tempo with the music. Along with her questions about Santa she is truly beginning to understand the world she moves through. I liked how she fiddled with her antlers, I am sure I ould have done the same if I could have even kept them on my head.
I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was Hannahs first day in the PreK class at primrose. Complete with new jumper uniform and excitement that bounced &amp;#8211; she grows up one milestone at a time and all to fast. When she tries my patience and wants to &amp;#8216;play games&amp;#8217; at 5:15 in the morning it helps me to remember that she won&amp;#8217;t always want me to play with her and these opportunities are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, Julie was trying to take a picture of her but Hannah was being camera shy. I know she missed the cutoff date because of her birthday but something tells me that it is going to be up to me and Julie to keep her interested in learning the things that spark her creativity and interests. With the realization that there is never a good time to raise taxes but the general public doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to understand that you get what you pay for. If we cut budgets and funding for teachers and education we will get what we pay for. While I can vote for things like Colorado&amp;#8217;s prop 103 because I believe in it there isn&amp;#8217;t much I can do to help increase funding for schools. What I can do is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah did some Fall maintenance on our pets. After doing that they went for a ride. Hannah rode by herself and learned to steer BoBo in a circle. Watch &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, a very lucky Mr. Kee Kee narrowly escaped becoming a coyote dinner. The coyote jumped the fence chasing him into the neighbors yard. I chansed the coyote away once and then went and got shoes and a flash light. I was gone less than a minute when Mr. Coyote jumped back over. I threw a river rock at him and shooed him away over the hill that sits between us and hole twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very pissed Mr Kee Kee went to the vet to get checked out. The conclusion is that he was very lucky and Julie and I have decided to enlist Hannah&amp;#8217;s help in keeping Mr. Kee Kee inside &amp;#8211; permanently. Julie did mention that she saw a few unlucky mice (bones) in the x-ray they took of Mr. Kee Kee when he was getting checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish we got the pictures of our e-rays. From personal experience I wish I had a collection of all mine. Not only would it help me keep track of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-spirit-of-that-memory-hannah-says&#34;&gt;In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the story forward, I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;The dragon was full and she lay down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>[](http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hop.jpg)Hannah&#39;s first book that she actively tried to read herself. &amp;nbsp;
Hannah is not quite reading the Dr. Seuss book, &amp;#8220;Hop On Pop.&amp;#8221; Despite the drama that seems to have become part of the night night routine, I really like reading books with her. She has me point to the words and read them and then she copies me. She gets impatient when there are more than one sentence and uses the pictures as context and reads ahead.</description>

      <title>Early Photoshop</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-04-25-early-photoshop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m running out of things to distract Hannah with. She seems to be feeling better but it&amp;#8217;s only been 3.5 hours since she last spiked a temp of ~103. In an effort to create something for her to do and give myself some more time to play with css for today I resorted to the computer. I have heard enought dora and diego the past three days so I need to be creative in how I present things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/04/early-photoshop/images/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-1905&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1905&#34; title=&#34;PBS Logo&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/images1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;226&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-far-today-8230&#34;&gt;So far today &amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She watched the entire pbs kids am lineup, did playdoh and stamps coloring by herself. She got all the basket toys out and got into an argument with Kee the cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get a few more minutes and avoid anything Dora or Diego, I showed her how to use the track pad and made her click through all my links. More css rules are needed. I also want to take some more of the rules out of JavaScript and put it into the stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that failed to keep her interested (&amp;#8220;Papa I want to play games on your computer,&amp;#8221; she says to me 🙂 )Enter the old office computer and photoshop. Hannah can use the &amp;#8216;computer pen&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was able to figure out how to hook emacs up to an ipad at work today. It&amp;#8217;s still pretty simple stuff, load the webpage I am working on and pop alerts. But still, if I can figure out how to debug the errors and get the command to send JavaScript to the device working &amp;#8230; this could be a huge timesaver for debugging mobile applications.
I&amp;#8217;m tagging this as a milestone only because it involves emacs, node.</description>

      <description>I am very impressed with the start-up time and I think it&amp;#8217;s because of the ssd. These things rip fast. When I was young I read about computers and robots. In the books, they, for the most part &amp;#8211; runaway sub processes like Hal and friends, did what they were told .Fast! Now, I say go to sleep and its asleep before I finish closing the lid if I do it gently.</description>

      <description>Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.
Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

      <description>Hannah is rapidly developin her language skills. if you can say it she will repeat it. she really likes sining her songs and demands that we listen to Hannah&amp;#8217;s music when driving in the car.
she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse.</description>

Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&amp;#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&amp;#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said,</description>

It seems we can only use the conversion kit or the safety rail. They are not compatible together. I wonder how many times she will fall out before we take the conversion kit off amd use the safety rail.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1217&#34; title=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; alt=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427-300x199.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bella Hunting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining.</description>

      <description>I outran the dreaded blue shell for the first time last night. Mario Kart Wii is the best video game I have played in a long time.

      <description>I just accidentally moved all images out of the blog folders and then deleted them when I thought they were test data. Crap. Why did I just do that? I guess I should have created real test data for my shell script to work on. 🙁
Update: yay for upgrades and backups. When upgrading to the latest wp software I realized that I had backups of the image folders and was able to replace them from my backup directory.</description>

      <description>My tiny girl is growing bigger by the day. She is getting to big to fall asleep
In my lap at bedtime. Lately she has been tossing and turning when we sit In the rocking chair looking at the moon and stars on the ceiling.
Tonight was the first time she wouldn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep for me. I had to put her in the crib so she could get comfy. Then her breathing slowed and her eyes closed and off she went to &amp;#8216;seep seep&amp;#8217; dreamtime land.</description>

      <description>I paid for a $10 movie ticket tonight. I hope Bond is worth it.
I paid $1.99 for high test gas this week. And, it wasn&amp;#8217;t even Costco.</description>
