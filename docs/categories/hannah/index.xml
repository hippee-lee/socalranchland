      <description>You can never escape your past and sometimes it gives you a happy return. Hannah found an old Ohio flag in my closet. I think it&amp;#8217;s from college but can&amp;#8217;t be sure.&amp;nbsp;
She had all kinds of questions why did I have it. Where was it from and what was it for and could she hand it up somewhere. When she stopped to take a breath I told her that I thought it was a great idea.</description>

      <description>Thank you Khan Academy. Hannah is a second grader at Pinecrest learning to multiply and divide. She is using your videos to supplement the class work and the draw with code lesson caught her eyes.&amp;nbsp;
With a bit of help from me, she drew her &amp;nbsp;own beautiful day. What a great tool! And red sky, that&amp;#8217;s so way cool !!&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>While distracted from fixing bugs, I made The Red River. Not the HBO version, the book version. The book is always better than the movie / tv show.&amp;nbsp;
Hannah&amp;#8217;s lined up nicely with mine: ﻿

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just sit still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing else. No thought. No feeling. No movement. Well you must breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Start with 29 seconds. Why 29? Episode 29 was a cool thing to see when I was a freshman in high school. But that&amp;#8217;s not why 29 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  It&amp;#8217;s that time of year again and back to school she goes. I can&amp;#8217;t believe it or perhaps I just don&amp;#8217;t want to. The smiles this morning were so large and full of life I was just happy to be able to watch her go.

      <description>Think for me  Focus on closing your eyes.
Focus, and stay perfectly still.
Focus, calm your mind.
Rest your body. And go to sleep. A smile does wonders for the reception of my delivery.  Lay down still.
Close your eyes, and rest.
Your mind. Sleep.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If I found a pot of gold I would be happy for my family. First I would get a puppy. Next I&amp;#8217;d get a phone. Then I&amp;#8217;d get a house. I&amp;#8217;d get a water bottle. Last I&amp;#8217;d get a mechanical pencil. I would like to have a pot of gold.&amp;#8221; [read more for picture]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I like doing art with Hannah. She thinks I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing. All I do is fallback on the things I know and make the rest up as I go along.
Chalk is my favorite medium to play outside together with her.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning Hannah and I did some glitter art. It was inspired by her &amp;#8216;discovery&amp;#8217; of some packets of glitter I found while cleaning the garage last weekend. She &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217; them on my workbench in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each took charge of one paper but helped each other decorate and gave advice on the art direction for the others project. I&amp;#8217;ll leave it up to you to guess who&amp;#8217;s is who&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From what I hear the tooth fairy has increased her rates so I guess I should invest in some iTunes gift cards.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe she is moving on from kindergarten. It seems like the long days of home work and coordinating drop offs, pickups and school events coalesce into a brief moment that passes by while I was blinking.
Now she can read, to me. Now she can do math, well adding and subtracting. Now she has bff&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; although they are quite dynamic. Now she can dress herself for uniform days or free dress days and she knows better than info what the rules are.</description>

      <description>Hannah had lots of fun at the Pincrest jump rope for the heart. They she has been using mine because the first one we got her didn&amp;#8217;t work as good as mine.
Yesterday we picked her out a new one and today she got a second one from school. Attached to it was this plane. She did the assembly all by herself on the ride home from school. Last Sunday I got to show her how the Volvo brakes come apart and go back together.</description>

      <description>I worked on a project with Hannah this week. We had to design and implement a Leprechaun trap that she could assemble at school. We were constrained to using materials found at home and that could be assembled at school.
We had two designs. The first, using an empty tissue box, was inspired by the raccoon traps in the book &amp;#8216;Where the Red Fern Grows.&amp;#8217; The trapping idea was that we would put something shiny in it.</description>

      <description>I want lights that are quickly configurable. There are two lights in Hannah&amp;#8217;s room and I turn them off several times a day. I want a program to manage it for me that can:

      <description>Letting go is the hardest parental job to do. Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &amp;#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&amp;#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the kiddo bench with tape.&lt;/strong&gt; There was an issue with the Ikea bench after four years of heavy use. Hannah informed us that it broke but she didn&amp;#8217;t break it. As a proactive measure though, she fixed it with tape. How creative I think to myself when we had this conversation. And, how awesome to get to witness that comprehension, observe her growth in understanding. Maybe it is just me but the observational apsect of being a parent is fascinating. As for Hannah, she knows tape is sticky and that one can tape things together. The bench needs something sticky to keep it securely on. That makes sense. If I knew what she knows I think I would do the same. Of all the things I ever thought were cool, this is up there as the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This year Hannah had her Holiday concert. She and her class were organized and on tempo with the music. Along with her questions about Santa she is truly beginning to understand the world she moves through. I liked how she fiddled with her antlers, I am sure I ould have done the same if I could have even kept them on my head.
I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was Hannahs first day in the PreK class at primrose. Complete with new jumper uniform and excitement that bounced &amp;#8211; she grows up one milestone at a time and all to fast. When she tries my patience and wants to &amp;#8216;play games&amp;#8217; at 5:15 in the morning it helps me to remember that she won&amp;#8217;t always want me to play with her and these opportunities are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, Julie was trying to take a picture of her but Hannah was being camera shy. I know she missed the cutoff date because of her birthday but something tells me that it is going to be up to me and Julie to keep her interested in learning the things that spark her creativity and interests. With the realization that there is never a good time to raise taxes but the general public doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to understand that you get what you pay for. If we cut budgets and funding for teachers and education we will get what we pay for. While I can vote for things like Colorado&amp;#8217;s prop 103 because I believe in it there isn&amp;#8217;t much I can do to help increase funding for schools. What I can do is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cool crisp fall day. The storms of the day before had moved of to the east. We got up early with the sunrise and had a simple breakfast. Toast for me and scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and grilled chicken for you. Sitting around is never good for the soul so we went out to Mr BoBo. Hannah rode in the arena and you and Whitney chased him for a bit, like you always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back home and I took care of a few things around the house. Once I got done I joined you and Whitney out on the deck with my guitar. You sat in the sun the way you always did. Upright on your haunches you enjoyed the view across the valley all the way over to the mountains. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s just boxers but when you sat there stoically and sweetly it just killed me that you were in such dire straits. As I played the song you came over to sit next to me and sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was my birthday and the best wife ever was going to a rock show (Foo Fighters) with me, we set you&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah did some Fall maintenance on our pets. After doing that they went for a ride. Hannah rode by herself and learned to steer BoBo in a circle. Watch &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, a very lucky Mr. Kee Kee narrowly escaped becoming a coyote dinner. The coyote jumped the fence chasing him into the neighbors yard. I chansed the coyote away once and then went and got shoes and a flash light. I was gone less than a minute when Mr. Coyote jumped back over. I threw a river rock at him and shooed him away over the hill that sits between us and hole twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very pissed Mr Kee Kee went to the vet to get checked out. The conclusion is that he was very lucky and Julie and I have decided to enlist Hannah&amp;#8217;s help in keeping Mr. Kee Kee inside &amp;#8211; permanently. Julie did mention that she saw a few unlucky mice (bones) in the x-ray they took of Mr. Kee Kee when he was getting checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish we got the pictures of our e-rays. From personal experience I wish I had a collection of all mine. Not only would it help me keep track of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah helped me pick out some new fish last night. Mr. Fishy died a few weeks ago when the tank had an oxygenation issue.
Since it was book club night Hannah and I had Mac n&amp;#8217; Cheese and then went to the pet store. She looked at all the fish but was more interested in the cats. She didn&amp;#8217;t want to choose I guided her into the Black Mollies and the Neon Tetras.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannah and I did some painting this afternoon. We did it out on the front porch because part of the process is making the paints, at least to start. The paint is some all natural stuff that is made from veggies and comes in powder form and gets mixed up with water. From past experience while painting with my daughter &amp;#8211; making up the paint is the least messy part of the session. But I told her that is why we were doing it outside, because it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if we are messy when we paint outside. We could just hose everything off after &amp;#8211; even her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah was a big help scooping the powder out and mixing in the water. OPnce we had the veggie paint set up we each did a few water colors and then she wanted black. Since we couldn&amp;#8217;t make black with the veggie paint Hannah finished up with the pre-mixed tube paints. When can I tell if her affinity with back is a goth tendency? Since I was not about to put paint all ovar myself to do handprints like she was I started trimming lilac shrubs. Then, when she was done I hosed Hannah, the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasses in back, next to the railing &amp;#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barberry plants &amp;#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &amp;#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&amp;#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch connector&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This morning while I was doing yard work Hannah did some work of her own. She went to the store (for real this time) and packed for camping. Now we are off to the store for some more sprinkler system parts and wood for the garden boxes.
Watching her at play is educational for me. I think my challenge as a parent is to disguise my advice (tips, tricks and my accumulated knowledge) in a way that she will accept it as her own idea.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-spirit-of-that-memory-hannah-says&#34;&gt;In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the story forward, I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;The dragon was full and she lay down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=3%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &amp;#8211; it has been a great Father&amp;#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &amp;#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later she asked me, &amp;#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her &amp;#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then my friends are cool.&amp;#8221; She said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we got&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>[](http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hop.jpg)Hannah&#39;s first book that she actively tried to read herself. &amp;nbsp;
Hannah is not quite reading the Dr. Seuss book, &amp;#8220;Hop On Pop.&amp;#8221; Despite the drama that seems to have become part of the night night routine, I really like reading books with her. She has me point to the words and read them and then she copies me. She gets impatient when there are more than one sentence and uses the pictures as context and reads ahead.</description>

      <description>Hannah was decorating a card for Mama Rosa and we told her to sign it. I told her the letters and she wrote them. It ended up on two lines because the blue and the brown decorations were in the way 🙂Hannah&amp;rsquo;s Signiture
In other news, Colorado&amp;#8217;s weather remains predictably unpredictable. Yesterday we had warm temps in the 80&amp;#8217;s and mostly clear and sunny sky&amp;#8217;s. Today it is raining with temps in the mid thirties, cloudy and I saw snow flakes in the air and on cars this morning.</description>

      <title>Early Photoshop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m running out of things to distract Hannah with. She seems to be feeling better but it&amp;#8217;s only been 3.5 hours since she last spiked a temp of ~103. In an effort to create something for her to do and give myself some more time to play with css for today I resorted to the computer. I have heard enought dora and diego the past three days so I need to be creative in how I present things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/04/early-photoshop/images/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-1905&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1905&#34; title=&#34;PBS Logo&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/images1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;226&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-far-today-8230&#34;&gt;So far today &amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She watched the entire pbs kids am lineup, did playdoh and stamps coloring by herself. She got all the basket toys out and got into an argument with Kee the cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get a few more minutes and avoid anything Dora or Diego, I showed her how to use the track pad and made her click through all my links. More css rules are needed. I also want to take some more of the rules out of JavaScript and put it into the stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that failed to keep her interested (&amp;#8220;Papa I want to play games on your computer,&amp;#8221; she says to me 🙂 )Enter the old office computer and photoshop. Hannah can use the &amp;#8216;computer pen&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah is running a fever again. On the one hand I know her immune system is getting stronger and more prepared to fight the future. On the other hand I was looking forward to taking her skiing tomorrow While everyone else snowboards.
I hope a good night of child sleep is just the thing she needs to bounce back.
Here are some pictures of me her last weekend. We found a hill close to home and went sledding, made snow sculpture and snow angels.</description>

      <description>Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.
Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

      <description>I was looking for something to watch on netflix tonight and came accross the following category:

Up until now I have been unaware of the &amp;#8220;Feel Good Good Talking Animal TV Shows&amp;#8221; Genre. Finding it made me smile.
I really like the Pingu animations. I like to watch them with Hannah because she really gets why it&amp;#8217;s funny. I have never seen someone focus so intently as she does.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

      <description>Hannah has mentioned monsters several times. I think it is because of Monsters Inc. Her and Shaye are very interested in them now. The purity of her emotion as she runs screaming from the room is priceless.</description>

      <description>Hannah is rapidly developin her language skills. if you can say it she will repeat it. she really likes sining her songs and demands that we listen to Hannah&amp;#8217;s music when driving in the car.
she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse.</description>

Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&amp;#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&amp;#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said,</description>

      <description>I tricked Hannah into going to her room friday night. She started out in my bed with mama and then i took her into her crib when i went to bed. It helped to hold her on my shoulder until she was uncomfortable and wanted to go to sleep. Then i asked her if she wanted to lie down in her crib. She said yes and was snuggling down, back to sleep in a few minutes.</description>

 singing an almost complete version of the abc&amp;#8217;s putting shoes on missing her mama in the morning completing full sentences that convey her understanding of more abstract concepts: Papa is Matthew, Mama is work. chasing Whitney around.</description>

      <title>Chair Fixing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1217&#34; title=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; alt=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427-300x199.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bella Hunting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining.</description>

      <description>That&amp;#8217;s Hannahs second two word combo.
Context: She was eating mac and cheese ( my favorite meal for as far back as I can remember ) and saw me put the pudding cups into the fridge.
She pushed her plate of mac and cheese away and pointed the pudding and said, &amp;#8216;I done. Want that.&amp;#8217;</description>

      <description>Vacation week is underway and Hannah is running a fever. This afternoon, she got all snuggly, and then her temp spiked to 104 for a few minutes. 10 long minutes later it was 102 and ten after that it was 100. Forty five minutes later it was normal, mama was home and Hannah was turning around yellng in that todler half speak that she makes up.
I&amp;#8217;m sure traveling will be interesting.</description>

She did great! Going to school is hard, I forgot how much so from the last time. I guess I did it to myself, I could have turned the scholarship down, but then I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have these interesting shell scripting word problems to solve. They make a pretty good puzzle. And this class only goes for a few more weeks.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts that need to be written down so I don&amp;#8217;t forget them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hannah knows what work is, sort of. This morning she woke up late, 7:30. (Such a great little sleeper) And Her first words to me were &amp;#8220;Mama?&amp;#8221; I am pretty sure she was asking where was Momma. So I said, &amp;#8220;Mama&amp;#8217;s not here kiddo, she is gone already.&amp;#8221; To which she replied, &amp;#8220;work.&amp;#8221; Later she did it again when Julie was on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strange Animal signs. When Julie was going through the letter flashcards she did this cute elephant trunk simulation with her arm. I took a video of it but haven&amp;#8217;t processed the raw footage yet. I&amp;#8217;ll try to get it posted before we leave for North Carolina on vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we were on a date night last night Hannah hung out with Shaye. Apparently they spent a few minutes pointing to each other and saying their names. Hannah points at Shaye and says, &amp;#8220;Saye.&amp;#8221; (I think she is still working on some of her phonetics). Then Shaye points at Hannah and says, &amp;#8220;Hannah&amp;#8221;. Form what I heard this repeated for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning. Hannah is a little&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>Hannah wanted to read the cat book this morning. We read it twice. Her favorite part was where the little kitten pops out of the rain boot and I say, &amp;#8220;meow, meow, meow!&amp;#8221;
Then we went through the alphabet cards. She is picking up more hand gestures from school, plus she is part Itallian and Italians talk with their hands. At least my family does, you should see the holiday gatherings!</description>

&lt;p&gt;You have been fighting an infection since late last week. On Sunday you hardly wanted to play. Just cuddle with momma and take naps all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before last you woke up at midnight. You settled into the chair next to my side and we read one of your books. The encyclopedia one. Then I read to you from a book I was reading, Heart in Atlantis by Steven King. I have read it before but I like the story. In about a half an hour you were sound asleep and I tucked you in and kissed you goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight when I moved you into you own bed you fussed a little bit so I rocked you like I did when you were little. You fell asleep on my shoulder and it was the best part of my day; next to eating yummy Julie cake fresh from the oven. Then when I thought you were asleep I moved you into the crib. You weren&amp;#8217;t asleep. I got you to lay down and gently rubber your back in comfort. It&amp;#8217;s been a while but I do remember what it&amp;#8217;s like to have a fever. After a few minutes you got quite again and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Pink Elephant pj&amp;#8217;s are for you Amy, since you liked the footie pajamas. I am not much of a fasionista, but, little girl clothes and shoes are pretty darn cute. So much so that I would even say its fun getting Hannah dressed in the morning. More fun than dressing myself since most days I could care less what I put on. When I dress Hannah, I actually think about stuff like matching and what she would like depending on the weather.</description>

      <description>Hannah learned to rinse herself off tonight. All on her own she started filling up the rinse cup and pouring it over herself. She only swallowed a few mouthfuls.
Other things of note: She is starting to connect two words together, like &amp;#8220;Hannah milk&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;up please&amp;#8221;. Also, her repetition is getting stronger. When I was home with her on Tuesday we went through the books and flash cards several times.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the late winter snowstorm threw a monkey wrench into my plans. Cheryle and Paul&amp;#8217;s flight was canceled so I get to swap snowboarding for Hannah duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far today we have had our morning coffee and milk, opened and closed the blinds over fifty times and played 52 card pickup with the flash cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What amazed me though is that Hannah decided it was elmo time and she didn&amp;#8217;t want to read the books. She went over the the tv (which i forgot to re -child lock) and opened the door to the DVD player where her elmo DVD&amp;#8217;s are, picked up Sesame Street &amp;#8211; Count With Me DVD and tried to put it into the player. All this just from watching me and Julie put dvds in to play. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll trade snowboarding for Hannah time anyday because riding is always there, but I can never have enough Hannah time. And she will only be little once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for later today are to go to REI and exchange my hat, visit Julie in Longmont for lunch, look for a split board at the store Julie said is going out of business, naps and shoveling the driveway so it doesn&amp;#8217;t turn into a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to Costco tonight to pick up a few things. While I was waiting for the guy to check on the camera model I wanted, I entertained Hannah with the piano. I mostly played keys and a few cords. Hannah banged on a few keys too but she was mostly interested in the buttons and knobs.
Then we started naming things. There was a display of iPods and Hannah astutely pointed out the apple logo that was just at her height and about twice as big as her head.</description>

      <description>Well Spring arrived in a big way this weekend with clear blue skys and temps in the mid 70&amp;#8217;s. Yesterday, e got the lawn ready by power raking it and top seeding. Hannah helped us by bonking her head three times and falling off the patio once, right on her face.
What else did we do, On Saturday we went to the REI grand opening at the Orchard Town Center Mall but did not stand in line for the free gift cards.</description>

      <description>While we were playing this morning Hannah wanted to wear my sunglasses. I told her she looked like a little spy.
I think she is like her pappa in that she doesn&amp;#8217;t like changes. They upset her internal balance mechanisms. When mamma and pappa go to work, it&amp;#8217;s a big change in her enviornment so it has been really traumatic for her since Kat started to watch her instead of Marie.</description>

      <description>Hannah strongly did not want me to get her dressed or brush her teeth this morning. She had to do it herself.
She also wanted Mammas muffin but could not have it. When she started complaining mamma used a bit if sarcasm in her voice when she told Hannah how mean we are. Do todlers understand sarcasm? Or did she just know that we were talking about her?</description>

Changed the oil in the Murano. I&amp;#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.
Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>After running a fever Sunday through Thursday, Hannah bean was feeling better today. So good, in fact that she played so hard she forgot to take an afternoon nap. So when momma picked her up she was tired!</description>

      <description>Hannah has been on a crazy book kick lately. In the morning she brings me four or five books to read and point out things she knows. Mainly she knows the animals. In the evening, she will do the same. Once, when I was helping Julie get dinner ready she kept bringing the Encyclopedia book to both of us and got pissed when we told her she had to wait a few minutes.</description>

      <description>Well the truck made it to Mary Jane but it&amp;#8217;s cold up here, about -4 at 9:30am. Hopefully she&amp;#8217;ll start for me when she cools back down 🙂
Thoughts I had on the way up:
Blender a spindrop logo. A raindrop clear bit colored with a hint of rainbow on it&amp;#8217;s surface and slightly twisted. Around the drop there is an orange halo spinning.
The truck made it home. Had a good 3 hour session.</description>

      <description>J, RK, and L saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tonight. It was a really good movie. Very effective and subtle cg and a good story line.
I find that post Hannah some movies affect me differently. The scene where BB sits and watches his daughter in the crib was really touching; I think because I have done that with Hannah. There is nothing more magical than watching your daughter sleeping and completely at peace.</description>

      <description>I was carrying you down to Masons house this morning and you almost jumped out of my arms. You really wanted to walk in the snow.
Then, when we got there Mason was already dancing to the radio and you joined right in. I didn&amp;#8217;t even have time to get your coat off.
On my way back I took a picture of your footprints in the snow.</description>

      <description>My tiny girl is growing bigger by the day. She is getting to big to fall asleep
In my lap at bedtime. Lately she has been tossing and turning when we sit In the rocking chair looking at the moon and stars on the ceiling.
Tonight was the first time she wouldn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep for me. I had to put her in the crib so she could get comfy. Then her breathing slowed and her eyes closed and off she went to &amp;#8216;seep seep&amp;#8217; dreamtime land.</description>

      <title>Signs of Object Persistance</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-11-26-object-persistance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to put things out of Hannahs sight and she would turn her attention else where. Now she remembers the object and seeks it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight she was playing with the dog leashes and I put them up because she was tripping on them. Age went over to the counter top and tried to climb up to reach them. A bit later she was spilling milk all over the aerobed. I put the milk behind me off the bed and she promptly got off the bed and went over and got it from behind my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also doing these funny behaviors: cuddling &amp;#8211; she will come over and crawl into you lap if you are sitting or crawl on top of you if you are lying down. She signed cat last night when Bella joined us and wanted tonpet her. That was one of the first signs we started wit but I have not given it to her for a while. Other signs she knows include: more, drink, eat, mamma/pappa (I think she does the same for both) dog &amp;#8211; but very similar to cat it seems, up, blows kisses and she is starting to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The upstairs gets cold at night. It seems like ten degrees cooler but I haven&amp;#8217;t measures with a thermometer yet. While Julie and I were out Xmas shopping ok our date night we got ceramic room heater because you have been waking up with cold ears, nose and toes. I set it up tonight and it seems to keep your room much warmer.
I don&amp;#8217;t think that is why you don&amp;#8217;t want to sleep though.</description>

She just goes and goes with an intense focused concentration. Thats prolly why she learns so much so fast.</description>

      <description>Hannah has been running a fever all day. 🙁
It started last night and has come and gone in waves all day. To try and make you comfortable we are alternating Tylenol and Motron on a regular interval. It&amp;#8217;s hard when your kiddo is sicko.
*update* Hannah is still got a fever; it&amp;#8217;s now going on three days. It fluctuates between 101 and 104. I am still giving her the Motrin/Tylenol treatments.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I traveled with Julie and Hannah to the Conejo Valley, she had training for work. Hannah and I hung out with Grandma Cheryle Today. I got a very good nap when Hannah took hers this afternoon, almost two hours. More of the same, I want to ride Sycamore but I have a couple of other things that I want to get done on the computer first so I may just go over there and get a quick trail run in. I have been running alot lately even though I profess to dislike it. I think that is because it is quick, out the door type exercise and convenient. I think I am going to take one of the rock climbing classes at the rec center this winter. Its been years since my harness has been used and I forget the knots and other stuff thats important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather here is really great. It was sunny and 85 today. It was overcast on Wednesday back in Erie but has cleared up even though fall weather has asserted itself in the last few days. Temperatures are only getting to the mid 50&amp;#8217;s or low 60&amp;#8217;s during the day and at night its getting below&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>**UPDATE** it turned out very well for Obama. Yay. Now he has to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. I really hope that he is better than either Bush or Clinton at working with others in the middle. The republicans lost alot of moderates so that will make things interesting for Obama and for the republican party itself. Could this be the start of a third party?</description>

    We had a blast in Maui for vacation.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I must say that is &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;really hard&lt;/span&gt;Ã‚Â slightly more difficult than usual to travel with Hannah. It was waaay different from the last time Julie and I went though. Then, we were on our honeymoon ad this time we were bringing Hannah bear.Ã‚Â Hannah only weighs ~20lbs but we brought what seemed like 120lbs of stuff for her. Babies require a lot of stuff.Ã‚Â
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Hannah started signing &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; for anything that she wanted, food, water, milk, and her momma. The second night there, it was my turn to take her when she woke up, she was on my bed and I was trying to get her to go back to sleep for an hour or so since it was only 3:30. She was having none of it. When she heard momma turn over on her bed she stood up, leaned on me and started frantically signing &amp;#8216;more.&amp;#8217; It was very cute. She also started saying &amp;#8220;uh oh&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; as in bah, and generally became very vocal with everyone when she was not extremely tired from lack of sleep. She is also trying to climb everything like mad.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

      <description>You have had some trouble adjusting to time zones. I doubt that you can even comprehend the distances involved in delineating the Maui time from the Denver time zone, yet.
That&amp;#8217;s ok, you have plenty of time to figure it out. Personally, I think it is harder to adjust when traveling west several zones and by the end of the week in Hawaii you were almost adjusted, then we flew you back.</description>

Hannah got another head Bonk this morning. She was walking around the bedroom while I was washing my face and ran into a corner. Her favorite food seems to be bananas (coincidence?). She hasn&amp;#8217;t given me any new signs lately but I am still giving her more, eat, mamma, pappa, dog, kitty and horse. Julie has been working with her object identification: where is the kitty? Where&amp;#8217;s papa, etc for most of those signs.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Momma went to the movies last night. We got to hang out with the dogs and Bella. First I fed you dinner, a mixture of squash and something else orange. You had been snacking on cheese and were showing very little interest in eating so I let you use your own hands to feed yourself. While you were making a mess and feeding yourself I was able to get a few more spoonfuls in. I tried to get you to drink some of the whole milk we are starting you on but you were not a big fan of it.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was bath time. You really like bath time. I tried your momma&amp;#8217;s approach of putting you in the tub standing up while the water warmed up. Then we did some bubble bath soap and you were so interested in the bubbles that you stuck your face under the water. It was only a second before you stood straight up, gasping for air. I guess you wanted a closer look at the bubbles.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After bath time we took the dogs for a walk. Bella followed us to the mailboxes so we had to pick her up and take her back&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The weekend we got her some new shoes that will help her motor around. Since the weather is starting to turn we also got her some cool new hats.</description>

      <description>I was feeding Hannah breakfast this morning and she showed me the sign for more! She really enjoyed herÃ‚Â bananaÃ‚Â and oatmeal cereal with yogurt. Almost every time I asked her, &amp;#8220;More eat?&amp;#8221; she did the more sign. It was really cool to see my little girlÃ‚Â communicatingÃ‚Â with me on her own level and I look forward to many more interesting conversations with her. I am especially interested in her world view as she grows and her experiences take her into the wide, wide world.</description>

      <description>Julie told me this morning that Hannah signed &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; to Marie yesterday. When Marie feeds her lunch she says &amp;#8220;More&amp;#8221; but usually doesn&amp;#8217;t sign it. Hannah gave her the sign when she said it.
This morning when I was holding Hannah she gave me a big, sloppy open mouthed wet kiss instead of turning away and giggling like she usually does. That made my doy no matter what happens.</description>

      <title>Your First Word: &amp;#8220;HI!&amp;#8221;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night Julie and I decided that your first real word is &amp;#8220;Hi.&amp;#8221; You say hi to everything and its really funny. We were sitting outside on the patio having dinner and you said hi to both Gurgi and Whitney, Bella and a plane flying by in the sky. This morning on the walk to The Heathers, you said hi to the clouds, a few houses, the guy walking his dog, Bella who was following us and Mason and Marie when we got inside the house.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to remember to bring the video camera to your room when I put you to sleep so I can have it there when you wake up in the morning. Thats when you are most talkative. You are getting better at walking. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet but Marie says you can take 6 steps on your own without any assistance. I betcha that by the time we get to Maui in October you will be mostly walking on your own.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your other recent behavior is to point (and say &amp;#8220;Hi&amp;#8221;). You really like it when I point back at you and touch you ET style. You still like to High-Five but pointing is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hard Walk (Hannah&amp;#8217;s First Bloody Nose)</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hannah is hard at work trying to learn to walk. She really doesn&amp;#8217;t like to crawl much, I don&amp;#8217;t think it is fast enough for her. Every day she gets more adventurous with her walking attempts. I see her just standing there practicing her balance alot; her stance reminds me of a snowboarder or skater stance when you are riding at speed. Besides practicing her balance by standing there, sometimes she coordinates everything together and can take 4-5 steps no problem. Other times the coordination things messes up her plans and she loses her balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend we went up near Lyons to visit a co-worker of Julie&amp;#8217;s who has a son, Logan, very close to Hannah&amp;#8217;s age. They were playing together and crawling around all over the place. When we went out to their deck Hannah tried to walk through the door but got tripped up coming through the doorway. She fell forward and bonked her face 🙁 A few minutes later all was better cause she was in Mommas arms and we noticed that she had a tiny bit of blood inside one of her nostrils. Her first bloody nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had anouther pretty active weekend. Saturday after getting breakfast at&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah, you crack me up. There are little bruises that ate migrating around your forehead. I can see how it hurts you when you Bonk your heavy little head. But sometimes, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s really funny and your momma and I can&amp;#8217;t help buy laugh.
Like tonight when we were lying on the floor playing, crawling and reading books and you were so happy. You werr just sitting there babbling and jumping on us and then I gave you the moracca.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I rode the 25 mile loop near Gold Hill Trailhead. Still can&amp;#8217;t do it under four hours but it is still a pretty fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we took Hannah on her first real hike with Whitney and Gurgi. We walked the 7.5 mile loop at Walker Ranch and it aeems i wore everyone out: dogs, daughter and wife. Towards the end J and I got annoyed with each other but worked it out. We may be in trouble when Hannah learns the art of manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner I went out to Bo and threw the saddle on him for a few laps. He did well, I can almost get him to do a few large circles at a gallup. Got bit up by moaquitos, we need to bring some bug spray out to keep with the tack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this I am getting some quality one one one Hannah time. Litterly, she is using me as a pillow before I put her down for the night. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it helps her sleep through the night better or not, but I like to spend this quit time with her just reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was definatly in the moment this weekend. I&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to San Diego this weekend and Hannah had a blast. I think it wore her out a little bit though. She got to meed Scott and Sarah&amp;#8217;s new puppy, Aggie and she got to see her Grandma Cheryle and Grandpa Paul while Julie and I went to a wedding. She had a great time with her grandparents and then On Sunday we took her to the San Diego Cove.</description>

      <description>Hannah was super tired last night. I took her for a walk with the pups last night while Julie went out to Mr. Bo. She fell asleep about halfway into it and then didn&amp;#8217;t want to go to sleep when we got back.
She is pretty funny when she tries to keep herself awake. It seems like she gets so tired that she gets more energy and excited so she can do more things before she crashes.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We had a great weekend, even though we missed Julie. While she was off in Cancun relaxing Hannah spent the weekend with my parents showing them her tricks: waving, standing and taking baby steps. When she wants something she is willing to let go of her support and take a step or two towards the object of her desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the bricks returned and the yard work done and even got Hannah some new sandals for the summertime. Even with my parents here, it is hard to take care of Hannah by myself. THe longer Julie was gone I noticed more little things that she did which are easy to take fro granted. I was glad to pick her up last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, Dad got the truck running again, apparently when I changed the plugs and wires I crossed cylinders 1 and 8). Dodge has a strange firing order on the &amp;#8217;97 Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things to do this week before we leave for San Diego:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix the electrical (Measure the diameter of the pvc pipe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset the middle sprinkler range at the top of the backyard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;reset the bricks where the ants dug sand up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;reset the bricks around the edge where it has settled a quarter&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a strange feeling to go over the M&amp;amp;S&amp;#8217;s last night with Julie gone and myÃ‚Â parentsÃ‚Â watching Hannah. Hannah did great last night. WeÃ‚Â wentÃ‚Â through her usual routine of playing, eating, and shower. Since it was only 6:30 Papa Rosa and I went to the auto part store to get a new distributer cap andÃ‚Â rotorÃ‚Â thingy. Hannah came with us and took a light nap on the way there. The auto store woke her up though and she stayed awake until we got home. She wasn&amp;#8217;t quite all the way tired so Mom played with her till she put her to bed. She stayed down all night! It was reported to me yesterday that she can stand on her own and take three or four steps at a time all by herself. I&amp;#8217;ll have to get a video of that. I can maybe post it on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah woke up this morning is a very smiley mood. She drank her bottle in less than ten minutes and then started crawling all over me and looking at the animals. We got up and went downstairs to get breakfast ready and Momma Rosa made Papa Rosa feed Hannah. She&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Silver Rush MTB race was fun but I didn&amp;#8217;t finish. Grrr, I am annoyed with myself for taking to many breaks. I got to the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; way point in 4 hours and 10 minutes and the cutoff time was four hours. Next year besides the AM Train I will need to ride the HA (High Altitude) Train alot more. I plan on going up to the colorado trail between Frisco and Breckenridge and doing that as an out and back. It won&amp;#8217;t be fifty miles but it should be close to forty and its at a decently high altitude. Riding or pushing a bike at 11,000+ feet is pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news; she is waving, almost saying Hi and crawling with a peg leg. She uses one leg to crawl like normal and the other leg is used with the foot flat on the ground to propel her around. She is pretty quick when she seesÃ‚Â somethingÃ‚Â she wants to go after like Momma, the dogs food dishes or the Bella the cat. Her legs are getting a bit of balance in them. I have seen her stand up unassisted, with no hands, for almost 20-30 seconds and she is taking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmm, last night was an interesting night. You would NOT go down for momma, even when she took you to bed with her. I took over around 10:30 or so and we sat in the rocking chair in the corner of your room. Last week I put a night light in there so that you don&amp;#8217;t wake up in a total black out. Last night you discovered light and shodows. For almost thirty minutes you watched me make one handed shadow puppets and move my head around. Then, I tried to get you to do them. after a few minutes of me holding your arm out into the light you started to move it around. I think you made the connection beteen the movement of your arm and the movement of the shadow on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also like to be talked to. You were interested in the shadows on the ceiling so I told you all about what we were doing with the shadows (making one handed puppets); then, when you started rubbing your eyes I started talking you down to sleep. I told you about the geometry of trees (really all plants). How the branches off the main stem can&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Very busy this week. I did an AM Train on monday but haven&amp;#8217;t ridden since then. GOAL: make to the 1&amp;frasl;2 way point in under 4 hours!
When Julie is sick and Hannah can&amp;#8217;t have unlimited access to her momma, Hannah gets cranky. She is getting very curious about her environment, crawling around and trying to pull herself up on all kinds of things. I need to do the stair gates because she likes to climb.</description>

      <title>Her Latest Trick</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-07-14-her-latest-trick/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannahs MOST FUN THING TO DO, lately, has been to pull herself up on something and then let go. She flaps her arms like a bird and tries to balance on two legs. The longest she can balance is for 10 &amp;#8211; 15 seconds. She is also starting to look at other objects that she can balance on and edge her self close to them. I can see her thinking, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll bet I can run to that before I fall!&amp;#8221; A little birdie is telling me that she will be walking before to long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also started saying &amp;#8220;OH!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is after we tell her &amp;#8220;NO!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its kinda funny. We are still workign on some basic signs with her: Eat, More, No, gentle Mamma and Pappa. Nothing back yet but I think she might be starting to get the communicaiton thing. She is sleeping well. What is working now is that she will go down with Julie around 8:30 &amp;#8211; 9:00 and then I&amp;#8217;ll take her into her crib when I come to bed, later. For the last few days she has been sleeping through the night until about 5:45am or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged about 120 miles last week, mostly on the AM&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh Hannah, you were so lonely last night. It broke my heart when I went into your room and you were sitting there looking at the little turtle lights and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I got the diaper situation in line and then rocked you back to sleep. It took a few position changes on your part, but we got you comfortable. Then, after you fell asleep, I held you a little longer so I could listen to the tiny snore that was coming from your cute little button nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little kiddo is getting bigger, but not so big just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really not a fan of riding a bike on the road, even commuter riding. Although, i was thinking today when I rode in that if I could ride three days a week that would save almost 120 miles of driving per week or:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6000 miles per year (assuming my company keeps us at only two weeks of vacation a year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 less fill ups for the Murano&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1350 less on gas per year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a lower resting heart rate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I saw five or six bannan peels on the side of the road when I was riding in, today they were all gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I did a training ride on Saturday, 25 miles on the colorado trail. I started from the Gold Hill Mine trailhead and went clockwise (if you are lookign east.</description>

      <title>Patio Done :: Hannah Almost Crawling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Patio is done, whew. Julie helped tremendously and I think it was more work than she realized. She was also able to take care of Hannah alot of the time so kudos to her for multi tasking. Cory helped to and its prolly because of him that we got done yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My estimated totals are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bricks and wall blocks moved &amp;#8211; 10,000 to 12,000 lbs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall foundation and road base moved &amp;#8211; 22 tons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason sand for paver leveling &amp;#8211; 2.5 tons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment rentals &amp;#8211; one paver saw for a day, one 225lb 14&amp;#8243; ground pounder rented twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned &amp;#8211; estimated wall block and pavers is not an exact science&amp;#8230; we have almost a pallet extra of rectangular pavers (but just the right amount of square pavers) and we have about &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a pallet of extra wall blocks. Next time I need to hire a day laborer to help move stuff from the front the back and seriously consider renting one of the hand powered front end loaders to help with moving/loading/excavating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hannah news she is standing like mad (with assistance) and can almost push herself up into a sitting position on her own. I give it a week ands she will be sitting up&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have had a hard time getting back to making regular posts since Vegas. I have also had a hard time getting in my training rides for the 50 mile MTB race coming up. I want to at least be able to finish it in under 7.5 hours.
Hannah is growing so fast now. All she wants to do is stand up. You can put her between the couch and the ottoman and she bounces back and forth moving all around until she plops down.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Busted in Vegas. It seems that people play jack 4 offsuit offline as well as online. Hah. Oh well, I guess that even though he was playing like a maniac, I should have thought a little more before calling his all in with only top pair after the flop. I played good other that that, there was just one other really bad call that I made. Until I lost to MR J4o I was up about $200, the pot with the maniac was the biggest pot I have ever been in before ($475) I am letting people draw too much I think and I could use a healthy dose of aggression to my game. Other times I bet the flop with what I thought was the best hand but didn&amp;#8217;t follow up on the turn and let one person get a straight and another person get to a flush draw. Hmm, need to start being more aggressive post flop when I play strong hands and hit part of the flop. That might give me more information if I bet or reraise when I am in position. Other that those types of hands (and the J4o) I played well from position. Had&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We felt and saw Hannahs fourth tooth on Sunday. She is getting closer to sitting up and, when sitting up, she is starting to lean forward in order to grab things that she wants. This morning, in bed, it was funny cause she would topple over and immediatly go into roll mode. Thats my girl &amp;#8230; she is already learning the proper way to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple gives a one year warranty for most of its products. My phone has been acting up so I took it in for some trouble shooting. They walked you through the usual steps of resetting the network connections and restoring the software but nothing really helped. People who were calling me still kept hearing echos on thier end. When I went back I was pleasantly surprised that the tech at teh Genius Bar just popped out my SIM card and swapped it into a new phone. This time I got the rubber condom for protection, but no belt clip for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lilac Circle Papas are headed to Vegas thursday night. I want to play tight/aggressive and double up my money. I am taking three buy ins for the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NL game and expect that good things will&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This late night Hannah fun is from two days ago. I had my server off for a few days so I am posting it now. She went to bed with Momma and woke up a bit earlier than usual, around 10:15pm. When she woke, boy was she ever conversational. She was talking and talking and just talking to herself i think. She talked to me all the way through her diaper change. She talked to the computer as I was shutting it down. She talked to Bella the cat when we let her out into the garage, to hunt mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since she was conversational I took her into the nursery and sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to her. Well, I sang the two verses I could remember over and over. Curious as ever, she started feeling my throat while I was singing. I think it helped her find her voice cause she started singing too. She sang and hummed and cooed her way to sleep on my right shoulder instead of the usual left side. This time, when I put her down in the crib she barely made a sound. She just rolled onto her side and that was that, off like&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You and momma went to bed early, around 8:00 or so. I watched &amp;#8216;Planet Earth&amp;#8217; for a little while and then I heard you at 10:00. You were happily awake. We went into the laundry room and got you set up with a fresh, dry diaper. The whole time you were talking and looking at stuff. Did you like the shadows made by the batheroom light? Were you trying to tell me that you were happy? Then we went into the routine fall asleep mode. I start by putting you on my left side with my arms keeping you close to my shoulder. We walk around for a little bit and then, because you are getting so big now, I sit down in the rocker. Now you stop talking and start getting comfortable. First you rest your little head on top of my shoulder. Then you nuzzle into the side of my neck. You are so warm and pleasent smelling, I softly hum a little bit to lull you under but you like to fight sleep for a bit. This time, the only sounds you make are getting comfortable sounds. When my neck doesn&amp;#8217;t twork out for you, you sink lower&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode into work today to get some extra riding in. Its weird, but when it is colder the air seems fresher or something. This morning and there was lots of tailpipe to smoke. To bad that&amp;#8217;s not what I like to smoke. Anyways, ride stats are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Distance &amp;#8211; 37.52 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Time &amp;#8211; 2:10:39 hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average Speed &amp;#8211; 17.23 mph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Speed &amp;#8211; 35.80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I think I&amp;#8217;ll get up a little early and try to get over 60 miles in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news: I went in to get her at her usual wakeup time of 5:15 and she was sleeping on her Stomach! That&amp;#8217;s huge for little miss &amp;#8216;I do not like to spend any time on my tummy&amp;#8217; 🙂 She is also able to stand up for a short time if you lean her against the couch. Yay! I am sure she will want to go snowboarding with us next year 😉 Julei and I have started practicing her crawling coordination. What is that you ask? Well let me tell you. We put Hannah on her back and one of us takes the legs while the other takes the arms. Then we alternate each side in a pseudo crawling motion. It&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I rode to work yesterday. Total ride time was 2:22. Total distance was ~37 miles. If I worked in the loop near Vista Ridge I should be able to make it more than 50 miles. Felt pretty good, I averaged a bit better than 15mph. Will need many more of these before the silverton 50.
We got up early this am and took Hannah to the balloon launch at the VR clubhouse.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hanna woke up earlier than usual last night, around 10:30. Julie was aleady asleep so I went to go comfort her. I think she had a scary dream and woke up all alone. She does not like to be alone right now because she calmed down when I changed her diaper and lulled her back to sleep on my shoulder while rocking gently in the corner of her room. I can only try to describe how pleasant I&amp;#8217;d felt to have her nuzle her face into the crook of my shoulder and her left arm around my neck. She was warm, content and I think she just wanted someone there while she fell back to sleep. I hope she had better dreams the second time around. Maybe she saw Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was a good one. One that, upon reflection, I can look back on and say that life is really good. Saturday we got a few things around the house done and I went out to Bo while Julie spent quality time with Hannah and took Whitney to the Vet &amp;#8211; she has an ear infection. In the afternoon, I got a workout in at the gym. I rode for 30&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No traveling, nothing urgent to do this past weekend and good time spent with Hannah made the weekend alot of fun. It started on Friday night when we got all the children together for some dinner. They were very cute playing together. Then we had some Wii time, Smash Bros &amp;amp; Martio Kart. A couple of beers and then off to bed.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up pretty early and were ready to go hiking on Saturday morning. Just around Betasso Preserve loop ~3.2 miles. Hannah did good on her second training hike, She fell asleep towards the end. On our way back home we stopped for an early lunch at the farmers market. Then it was off to home for a mid day nap. It was a very good nap. Woke up around 3:00 or so and played with Hannah some more while Julie went out to see Mr Bo. We had dinner and put Hannah to bed at her usual time and then watched a movie, Juno. It was pretty good. It gave me an idea for how to manage my Netflix queue. Instead of waiting for them to recommend a move for me, I just look at what is currently&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yesterday Marie reported that Hannah popped her first tooth. That explains why she was so cranky Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in San Francisco. Yeah, she only has 19 more to go 😉
On tap for tonight, after Julie gets home from picking up the Volvo is Wii at the Heathers, I think Cory got the Super Mario Carts game and I just got the Super Smash brothers game so it should be fun.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a cold wet ride in to Boulder. It was about 40 degree when I left Erie and not raining. By the time I got to Lafayette it had started raining and by the time I came into Boulder it was snowing. I wish my truck was running today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Just got back from four days in San Francisco and I found out how hard it is to work and watch Hannah. I think she is getting bored pretty easily now. I noticed that she is happy entertaining herself for a little while, maybe half an hour. Then she wants some attention or different stimulation. In the mornign she would have her naps and play sessions and I could get some stuff done but then she would get fussy. By the time I went out to meet Julie for lunch she would be a bit cranky. Then I would put on the Bjorn and one of her hats (tangent: i got her a really cute reversible green and white / light green and pink flowers hat that straps on below her chin) and out we would go. As soon as we got into the elevator she would start smiling at anyone near&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, running out the door to work Julie stopped me and said, &amp;#8220;Hey come here I have something for you to do.&amp;#8221;Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reply was to sigh and so ok, what is it. SInce my mind was already out the door on my day, and the noon bike ride I had planned.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;#8221; come upstairsÃ‚Â with me&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave me Hannah when I got to the top of the stairs. Holding my daughter I followed her in to the office where she got her camera and then led us into theÃ‚Â nursery. &amp;#8220;We are going to take pictures of the Giraffes for your Aunt Lulu,&amp;#8221; she said. A light bulb went off in my mind.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sat Hannah in her boppy and took a seat next to her. The Giraffes are thirty two years apart in age but you can tell that they are related. Mine has faded white fuzzy skin, ragged hair on its main and dilapidated horns on top of its head. It is still standing but it kind of leans over to the one side now.Ã‚Â Hannah&amp;#8217;sÃ‚Â Giraffe is a little taller, completely full of stuffing and bright, bright yellow. My giraffe stood next&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;p&gt;
    On Friday, when I fed Hannah dinner, she started a new behavior. When I gave her the sign for &amp;#8216;eat&amp;#8217; and showed her the spoonful of baby food she opened her mouth like a little birdie. It was very cute. She did it until she got full or tired of the repetition. Watching her this past weekend I saw that she is starting to give signs of wanting but I don&amp;#8217;t think she knows she is doing it yet. Besides opening her mouth like a little bird, sheÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â has moments when she only wants Momma :)Ã‚Â
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Good weekend, great weather. We went for two &amp;#8216;hikes&amp;#8217; this weekend with Hannah. Last Saturday Julie and I got up early, went to breakfast at the farmers market on 11th St. Later we went up to the Bebaso trail/loop west of Boulder. Hannah first hike was fun. She fell asleep for the first half but was awake for the last mile or so.Ã‚Â On Sunday we went with Cory, Jen and Mason and walked around on the Boulder Creek Path. Both hikes were great little warmups and I look forward to some good backpacking with her.Ã‚Â

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Spring finally broke for good this past weekend. Hannah got to spend lots of time with her maternal grandparents. Paul and Cheryle drove up from Thousand Oaks for a long weekend. They watched Hannah while Julie and I cleaned the garage and patched all the cracks from the mud jacking. While I was turning on the sprinklers, Julie went out to ride Bo. Later that night we got a movie date night out of it while the grandparents put Hannah down to bed. From the &amp;#8216;report&amp;#8217; we got later that night she wasn&amp;#8217;t thrilled about not being put down by a regular (Me or Julie) but she rolled with it and let them calm her down and comfort her to lala land. For our date we went and saw 21, which i thought was ok but nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we got up early and Julie and I ran in the Canine Classic. It was fun, there were a ton of dogs everywhere and the weather was really nice. Not to hot, not too cold, just right for running 5 kilometers. After the race we went into Boulder for brunch and then went home for a nice mid afternoon siesta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No tooth for Hannah yet. She was really happy this morning though and is still drooling like a mad baby and I am pretty sure that she does not have rabies. That means she is still getting closer to popping that first tooth. SHe is eating pretty well now, she really likes fruit. Julie told me that she ate the whole serving of bananas this morning.Ã‚Â It seems Hannah likes bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the eels show last night. Went with M my neighbor and a group of people. Was a good show at the Fox Theater in Boulder. A little crowded but atmosphere was pretty intimate and he puts on an entertaining show. He played a wide range of selections (old and new) and I found out that he is a really good drummer. Before the show they were playing the DVD that came out with his latest album. I saw that he also has a book so I found it on amazon this morning and placed an order. Should be an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It snowed today and I think that will hold up Cheryle and Paul. They stayed in Grand Junction last night and will get here today if there isn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Any day now we expect Hannah to pop her first tooth. She is gumming anythign she can get into her mouth like crazy. Her fist, frozen rubber things with bumps on it, even my fingers. She is starting to like the solid food thing; at least from the output perspective that I have. We have had her on rive and whole grain cereal for about two weeks now and Julie just introduced some fruit this past weekend.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Hannah is trying to &amp;#8216;train&amp;#8217; us 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night when I was putting her to bed she was fine if I held her, fine if I was giving here a little baby massage while lying in her crib on her side; but not fine if I stepped out of the room. I went to get something from the laundry room and she immediatly started crying. As soon as I came back into the room she stopped, but only for a second and then got louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took about ten minutes to relax her enough so that she was lulled into light sleep. I was able to slip out of the room then. I decided to give her five minutes to work things out for herself. She cried out a few times, each time getting softer and then sullenly went back to sleep. She stayed asleep until 1:30 or so when Julie took put her back down. Then she didn&amp;#8217;t wake us until 7:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dogs are still smarter than me, yesterday they got out of the yard and ran around the neighborhood like crazy boxers.Ã‚Â I got the other doggy fence from the basement and put it up so they&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I went to Ohio for Easter this year. Katie and Rob came down from Montana and then we Drove from Colorado to Cleveland with Hannah and the pups. Total time on the road was right around 48 hours there and back. It only took about twenty hours to go city to city. Weather wise it was pretty good. On the way there we hit some snow in Chicago that got worse the closer we got to Cleveland but that was all.</description>

      <description>I was carrying Hannah around and we were looking at stuff in the garage. She has been reaching for things for a few days now and recently she is getting her coordination dialed in. That is, she is getting what she reaches for. I was looking at my mountain bike when she reached out and grabbed a spoke on Julies road bike that is hanging from a hook. As I moved away she kept holding on.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;#8217;t go up to Winterpark this weekend. I tried to make it up to eldora but that didn&amp;#8217;t happen either. We did take Hannah to the zoo. I got the whole house humidifier installed and played some wii after Hannah went to sleep.
We also got a kid carrier for Hannah, a sherpani I think. Hiking this spring should be fun. One way to make sure it happens enough is to put it on my google calander and then send invatations/reminders to other interested parties.</description>
