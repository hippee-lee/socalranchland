      <description>The answer we seek is not always obvious. As we grow and gain experience we become skilled in sussing out the easy answers. But what about when it&amp;#8217;s hard? When the path is not as well traveled?
Walk on soldier. Persevere and gain the victors spoils for they are well worth the price you must pay.
 &amp;#8230;the willingness to explore the least likely pathways is important for often there can be no other reason for exploring such pathways.</description>

      <title>Break It First</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to program, learn how to break shit first. Some tools (git) make it easy to break. Eventually, once you break enough shit, someone who knows you can break will challenge you. Challenge you to fix something that someone else broke or address a problem that has never been solved but holds them back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution is Migration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything evolves. Not quite the same as the Darwinian definition of the word but its a close metaphor. But, in the small, learning and adapting behavior to take advantage of knowledge sense of the word. That&amp;#8217;s why animals, people included, migrate. Birds go where it&amp;#8217;s warmer and the food is easy. People migrate around various web properties because they find value for their time there. Then a new shiny service starts up and they migrate again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Go Big or Go Home</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just re-read what I put on the two pages bookending the &amp;#8220;Think Big&amp;#8221; two page spread in the in5 book. If I am not going to DO, why do I show up? To put it into a perspective that I have, lets talk riding. Riding anything, everything. I hope you like to ride as much as I do or at least have a passion for something that takes a mastery of your mind and your body in concert. For me thats where the soul lives. In the best rides, the lines that are the most fun are also the most challenging. Those are the sessions that force me to be &lt;em&gt;in the moment&lt;/em&gt; and I don&amp;#8217;t think. Once the trail is behind me I&amp;#8217;ll usually say to myself, &amp;#8220;Wow! That was fun.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it fun? That is the most important thing. Are the problems that you solve fun? If not, why do you wait for it to be fun &amp;#8211; make up a game for one. The volvo repair shop wants $850 to put in a new alternator and I can get it the same day. I would rather find something else to do with that money. So car repairs,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fall Planting</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-08-08-fall-planting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasses in back, next to the railing &amp;#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barberry plants &amp;#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &amp;#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&amp;#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch connector&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Made This</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-07-31-i-made-this/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I built this. It is a split level addition to the deck. Complete with rose garden and paved path next to the house that leads to a sitting area (or golfers private driving range?) where you can watch your garden grow as golfers play through just like on tv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got done yesterday (The hottest day of the year) I sat, watched and I enjoyed a cool, refreshing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after I finished the heavy manual parts, we took Hannah to see a U2 cover band headline one of the Erie Concerts in the park series. I really enjoy them and like it better in the new park. Hannah was fascinated with the band, Once the Chik Fil A cow got out of the way she got her rock and roll dance on. It was fun &amp;#8211; I swung her around, showed her the hop and she carried the Irish flag around for a while. Although I think they do stuff with flag like shapes outside at school and her and Shaye seemed to want to shake the flag more than carry it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that this was the hottest day of the year? The car registered 101 when we got the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Identify Your Value</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-02-28-identify-your-value/</link>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The book starts off with a great line:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DECIDE WHATS NEXT IN YOUR LIFE AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO GET IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if strategize is a word but the idea is both powerful and subtle. We always tell each other our greatest wants, if only. Most of my if only&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t require huge amounts of money. More than money they require time and flexibility. Ask a meterologist to predict the next snow storm he can&amp;#8217;t do it, not with high accuracy. He can run the models, know the climate and the different types of weather patterns; but they are wrong more often that they are right because weather is random, truly unpredictable. The storms never hit exactly when they are supposed to, they never have as much or as little as they are supposed to. As in Life. So if i can&amp;#8217;t predict whats next and life is random, how do I get my &amp;#8216;If only&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s convenient for me?&amp;#8217;

      <title>Game Progress</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2010-12-09-game-progress/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading the &amp;#8220;choose your own adventure&amp;#8221; Books as a child and they were great fun. I didn&amp;#8217;t discover computers until college and missed out on the text adventure genre. The lisp exercises that Dr. Barski is taking me through are great fun. I really like the graphviz tool he created to vizualize the game nodes. I will be able to use that in some other areas that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding that a scientific approach works well with his style of teaching. When I was in school for biology I did my best lab work when properly prepared. This entailed reading through the experiment/lab first and making sure I was familiar with all of the terms. Then, the experiment/lab was more fun to complete because I knew what to expect and the unanticipated things that came up were not roadblocks. I have been approaching the Land of Lisp book in a similar way: read the chapter first, try to understand the code he has written and look up new terms that I am not familiar with and then writing the code to get it running on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to getting GTW (Grand Theft Wumpus) working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
