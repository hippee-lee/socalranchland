      <description>Busy morning. Got tons of stuff done üôÇ
Changed the oil in the Murano. I&amp;#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.
Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>**UPDATE2** boulderwindshields.com was great, they showed up early at my work location and had it filled in about ten minutes. you can still see where the chip was, barely. Hopefully it won&amp;#8217;t crack any further.
**UPDATE** boulderwindshields.com looks promising: $59.95 for the first chip. $30 better than the online quote J got. I filled out their contact form and am waiting to hear back from them.√É‚Äö√Ç
Julie found an online quote of $99 to repair a windshield chip in the Murano.</description>

      <description>I have the side yard (dog run) apart while I fill in the low areas of backfill around the foundation that has sunk. I am also putting a split rail fence, that T&amp;#8217;s off the fence√É‚Äö√Ç separating√É‚Äö√Ç our yard form the neighbors house, with a gate to seperate side yard from back yard. I&amp;#8217;ll also need to spread some some cover material that is not river rock. River rock is quite possibly the worst landscaping material I have ever seen or worked with.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a strange feeling to go over the M&amp;amp;S&amp;#8217;s last night with Julie gone and my√É‚Äö√Ç parents√É‚Äö√Ç watching Hannah. Hannah did great last night. We√É‚Äö√Ç went√É‚Äö√Ç through her usual routine of playing, eating, and shower. Since it was only 6:30 Papa Rosa and I went to the auto part store to get a new distributer cap and√É‚Äö√Ç rotor√É‚Äö√Ç thingy. Hannah came with us and took a light nap on the way there. The auto store woke her up though and she stayed awake until we got home. She wasn&amp;#8217;t quite all the way tired so Mom played with her till she put her to bed. She stayed down all night! It was reported to me yesterday that she can stand on her own and take three or four steps at a time all by herself. I&amp;#8217;ll have to get a video of that. I can maybe post it on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah woke up this morning is a very smiley mood. She drank her bottle in less than ten minutes and then started crawling all over me and looking at the animals. We got up and went downstairs to get breakfast ready and Momma Rosa made Papa Rosa feed Hannah. She&lt;/p&gt;</description>
