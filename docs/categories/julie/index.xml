&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got invited out with some new friends and were lucky enough to see the Cavalia show down I&amp;#8217;m Burbank last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little girls, big eyes and some brilliant horseman and horsewomanship.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Ah, morning coffee and a nice walk over to the clubhouse. Much better today than yesterday; I was warmer and I felt better. I have about a hundred pictures posted to Google+ that I shared with Family and Friends. Let me know if you can&amp;#8217;t find them.
These are my favorite pictures of the morning.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the kiddo bench with tape.&lt;/strong&gt; There was an issue with the Ikea bench after four years of heavy use. Hannah informed us that it broke but she didn&amp;#8217;t break it. As a proactive measure though, she fixed it with tape. How creative I think to myself when we had this conversation. And, how awesome to get to witness that comprehension, observe her growth in understanding. Maybe it is just me but the observational apsect of being a parent is fascinating. As for Hannah, she knows tape is sticky and that one can tape things together. The bench needs something sticky to keep it securely on. That makes sense. If I knew what she knows I think I would do the same. Of all the things I ever thought were cool, this is up there as the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TapeFix-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2927&#34; title=&#34;TapeFix-1&#34; src=&#34;http://192.241.192.98/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TapeFix-1-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; srcset=&#34;http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TapeFix-1-300x199.jpg 300w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TapeFix-1-768x510.jpg 768w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TapeFix-1-1024x680.jpg 1024w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TapeFix-1.jpg 1280w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decorate the fish tank.&lt;/strong&gt; There was a morning tummy ache yesterday. Julie stayed home with H but still had to do some work stuff. I guess she was on a conference call when Hannah decorated the fish tank. There is tha card we got from John and Lori after Grugi died and some kinderart to start with. I think the fishy&amp;#8217;s will enjoy the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Land Of Pleasant Surprises</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to the zoo this morning for the annual trick-or-treat session. It was a little crazy with amostt 20 people and over half of us kiddos. This doesn&amp;#8217;t count grown up kiddos, only kiddos of legal age.
There were a few dramatic moments but overall thhings went pretty smoothly and we stopped at Cinzetti&amp;#8217;s Resturaunt for lunch. There is no better place to go with 10+ hungery, sugar overloaded kiddos.</description>

      <title>Gurgi&amp;#8217;s Last Day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cool crisp fall day. The storms of the day before had moved of to the east. We got up early with the sunrise and had a simple breakfast. Toast for me and scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and grilled chicken for you. Sitting around is never good for the soul so we went out to Mr BoBo. Hannah rode in the arena and you and Whitney chased him for a bit, like you always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back home and I took care of a few things around the house. Once I got done I joined you and Whitney out on the deck with my guitar. You sat in the sun the way you always did. Upright on your haunches you enjoyed the view across the valley all the way over to the mountains. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s just boxers but when you sat there stoically and sweetly it just killed me that you were in such dire straits. As I played the song you came over to sit next to me and sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was my birthday and the best wife ever was going to a rock show (Foo Fighters) with me, we set you&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solo Ride</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah did some Fall maintenance on our pets. After doing that they went for a ride. Hannah rode by herself and learned to steer BoBo in a circle. Watch &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, a very lucky Mr. Kee Kee narrowly escaped becoming a coyote dinner. The coyote jumped the fence chasing him into the neighbors yard. I chansed the coyote away once and then went and got shoes and a flash light. I was gone less than a minute when Mr. Coyote jumped back over. I threw a river rock at him and shooed him away over the hill that sits between us and hole twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very pissed Mr Kee Kee went to the vet to get checked out. The conclusion is that he was very lucky and Julie and I have decided to enlist Hannah&amp;#8217;s help in keeping Mr. Kee Kee inside &amp;#8211; permanently. Julie did mention that she saw a few unlucky mice (bones) in the x-ray they took of Mr. Kee Kee when he was getting checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish we got the pictures of our e-rays. From personal experience I wish I had a collection of all mine. Not only would it help me keep track of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fall Planting</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-08-08-fall-planting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasses in back, next to the railing &amp;#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barberry plants &amp;#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &amp;#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&amp;#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch connector&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &amp;#8211; it has been a great Father&amp;#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &amp;#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later she asked me, &amp;#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her &amp;#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then my friends are cool.&amp;#8221; She said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.
Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

      <description>This morning Hannah woke Julie up with the birthday card she colored for her.
it was a sunny almost 80 degree spring day. Hannah did soccer at Primrose and then we made cup cakes while we waited for Liu&amp;#8217;s take out to arrive.
Hannah needed a bath after helping Julie clean up the cake batter bowl.</description>

      <description>Julie took Hannah to her first theater movie: The Princess and the Frog.
Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&amp;#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&amp;#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said,</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1217&#34; title=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; alt=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427-300x199.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bella Hunting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>It wad a nice weekend but a little busy.
On Saturday, Hannah and I went to the childrens hospital near our house. There Hannah got to see real a real fire truck, an ambulance, and a police car. The vehicles she was fascinated with. The vehicle operators, not so much. Then we were supposed to go to the Erie concert in the park but it looked to much like bad weather so Mason, Riley and Shaye (and the associsted parental units) joinednus for</description>

      <description>Had a seriously good time last night with Julie at the ninja show. There was a 1&amp;frasl;4 moon setting in the western sky, an 800 fill sleeping bag to keep us warm and rock show loud enough to make the ground vibrate. Head Like A Hole always jams, hard.
This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts that need to be written down so I don&amp;#8217;t forget them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hannah knows what work is, sort of. This morning she woke up late, 7:30. (Such a great little sleeper) And Her first words to me were &amp;#8220;Mama?&amp;#8221; I am pretty sure she was asking where was Momma. So I said, &amp;#8220;Mama&amp;#8217;s not here kiddo, she is gone already.&amp;#8221; To which she replied, &amp;#8220;work.&amp;#8221; Later she did it again when Julie was on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strange Animal signs. When Julie was going through the letter flashcards she did this cute elephant trunk simulation with her arm. I took a video of it but haven&amp;#8217;t processed the raw footage yet. I&amp;#8217;ll try to get it posted before we leave for North Carolina on vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we were on a date night last night Hannah hung out with Shaye. Apparently they spent a few minutes pointing to each other and saying their names. Hannah points at Shaye and says, &amp;#8220;Saye.&amp;#8221; (I think she is still working on some of her phonetics). Then Shaye points at Hannah and says, &amp;#8220;Hannah&amp;#8221;. Form what I heard this repeated for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning. Hannah is a little&lt;/li&gt;
