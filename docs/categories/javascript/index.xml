      <description>Thank you Khan Academy. Hannah is a second grader at Pinecrest learning to multiply and divide. She is using your videos to supplement the class work and the draw with code lesson caught her eyes.&amp;nbsp;
With a bit of help from me, she drew her &amp;nbsp;own beautiful day. What a great tool! And red sky, that&amp;#8217;s so way cool !!&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>From Anatidae&amp;#8217;s comment on the web:
  If you&amp;#8217;re messing with the DOM, do it in a directive If you&amp;#8217;re modifying your data, do it in your controllers or services.  If you&amp;#8217;re defining data, do it in a factory.   Also, the faster you forget about jQuery, the fasterÂ you will be productive buildingÂ an Angular app. You can always bring it back later if you still want to and you may run into in in disguise in one of your directives.</description>

      <description>I was writing some tests for a singleton I need to create and thought this blockÂ was cool:
[js]
it(&amp;#8216;should be a Singleton object&amp;#8217;, function () {
var a = siteDNA.getInstance();
var c = siteDNA.getInstance();
expect(a).toBe&amp;copy;;
});

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had neglected the editor setup on my personal laptop for a while. The only thing that was even close was emacs because I really like org-mode as catch all for things that I want to version control and drag around with me. At work I had started to really like Sublime Text 2 but didn&amp;#8217;t know until after I bought it that it was going away and the license doesn&amp;#8217;t count for ST3. Oh well, I can live with ST2 until it dies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zumbox is winding down and I&amp;#8217;m iterating through updated versions of my resume and cover letter. I&amp;#8217;ve been testing the water around TO this week and there are opportunities for sure. Doing the new browser client in AngularJS was very fortuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to take an Angular path to some more JS enlightenment*Â &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-My-Experience-With-AngularJS-The-Super-heroic-JavaScript-MVW-Framework.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s highs for me were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope, $scope and direct binding to the DOM elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directives as reusable widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory services with the builder pattern for extending an objects functionlity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaYaaq2Miw&#34;&gt;Promises, Promises&lt;/a&gt; andÂ &lt;a href=&#34;http://taoofcode.net/promise-anti-patterns/&#34;&gt;Promise Anti-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still going up (and down ðŸ™‚ ) &amp;#8211; every time I drop into the angular source code to trace or debug issues I am treated to a mind expanding experience. And it&amp;#8217;s very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Design A Tall (JavaScript) Function</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-design-a-tall-javascript-function&#34;&gt;How to design a (tall JavaScript) function:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&#34;&gt;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching the video for &amp;#8220;Design a function to determine if an image is tall.&amp;#8221; and using the tall-starter.rkt in DrRacket. As an exercise I transposed it into JavaScript with the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must get a working prototype as fast as possible (10 minutes or less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it my own ad hoc way since jasmine/karma/protractor are libraries/frameworks and not native to browsers
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Un Using Chrome</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-12-19-un-using-chrome/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-12-19-un-using-chrome/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gave up on using chrome for google apps. Ever since they opened up google+ for public use they changed something about the authentication system and my computer running chrome really does not like it. It makes me log in to each app multiple times per day. Intermittently I would get the you must enable javascript or clearn you cache and cookies blah blah blah. Well its been several months and JavaScript has always been enabled. I think my cache and cookies are clear enough to fry an egg on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have even tried to uninstall and re-install but not that the time spent trying to figure out why wants me to log in for each app, multiple time a day it is time to use tool that don&amp;#8217;t get in the way of what I need or want to do and re-logging into a web service multiple times a day is not what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went back to firefox for google plus and the document s. I am going to use apples mail and cal apps for those accounts. I guess the plus side is that I don&amp;#8217;t need to see any of the adds &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>var that = this; // I after yesterday&amp;#8217;s bug in the mobile flag I understand.
That can be used to reference the original object, even if you are nested inside it.

      <title>Fun With Emacs</title>

      <description>I was able to figure out how to hook emacs up to an ipad at work today. It&amp;#8217;s still pretty simple stuff, load the webpage I am working on and pop alerts. But still, if I can figure out how to debug the errors and get the command to send JavaScript to the device working &amp;#8230; this could be a huge timesaver for debugging mobile applications.
I&amp;#8217;m tagging this as a milestone only because it involves emacs, node.</description>

      <description>The following JavaScript doesn&amp;#8217;t work in IE:
 var list = [&amp;#8216;.item1&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;.item2&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;.item3&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;&amp;#8230;
list.forEach(
function (item) {
$(item).hide();
});
 Sad. I wonder if the array object could be extended r prototyped to add that if IE is detected?</description>

      <title>Because It&amp;#8217;s There</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a post by someone who used to work at youtube a while back. He was talking about how most of the people he interviewed could not work on the DOM with-out jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like jQuery, it makes my job much, much easier even in the bastardized form I have to use it in. But, I liked the challenge and decided to work on the DOM with out a library, only using pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a few weeks of 2 hour nightly sessions to prototype, but I have something that runs. You can see the repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/hippeelee/ticker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I added a page called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/ticker.html&#34;&gt;ticker&lt;/a&gt;. Its a bare bones demo and still more concept than practical utility, but I am having fun fleshing it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are more elegant tools and plug-ins that do the same thing. It feels good to do it for myself, just because I can. A bit like cultivating a home garden. Sure, I am not on the scale as the professionals and sure, my solution is not ideal. But that wasn&amp;#8217;t the point &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOM with images was there and now I can make them do what I want. I learned a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am amazed at how long I went with out installing js2-mode on the netbook. To make it easy, I used the emacs default kit for saner defaults. Seems to work nicely.
I haven&amp;#8217;t been back to the orc battle since Christmas. I have been coding with the ruby koans and a fun little js project I am calling ticker. The idea is to use only pure js to make elements on a page tick, like a digital clock ticks its nuimbers away.</description>

      <description>After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.
i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.
I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods.</description>

      <title>Object Matters</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-05-21-object-matters/</link>

      <description>From the book JavaScript: The Good Parts is this little gem.
The lineage of an object is irrelevant. What matters about an object is what it can do, not what it is decended from.
&amp;#8230;
Prototypal Inheritance:
You start by making a useful object. You can then make many more objects that are like that one.</description>

      <title>Matthews Fizzbuzz</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During lunch I came across a reference to the fizzbuzz question (ie for the integers between 1-100 &amp;#8230; print fizz if the number is divisble by 3, buzz if divisible by 5 and fizzbuzz if divisible by both) in reading someone&amp;#8217;s blog. I have always said to myself, I need to see how long it will take me to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javascript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;var fizzbuzz = function(){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;Matthews Fizzbuzz&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//an array to hold my numbers and numses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var nums = new Array();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for (x = 1; x &amp;lt; 101; ++x){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nums.push(x);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for (z=0; z &amp;lt; nums.length; ++z){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if(nums[z] % 3 == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; nums[z] % 5 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;fizzbuzz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}else if(nums[z] % 3 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;fizz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}else if(nums[z] % 5 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;buzz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;else{&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(nums[z] + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var start = new Date();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;start = start.getTime(); Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ // returns millisecs since epoch which is what I want since this operation takes less than a second&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;start += parseInt( start );&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fizzbuzz();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var end = new Date();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;end = end.getTime();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;end += parseInt( end );&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;This took &amp;#8221; + (end &amp;#8211; start) + &amp;#8221; milliseconds to run&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes: it took me about five minutes give or take and I have seen it report between 2-4 milliseconds to run. The current program is 33 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emacs Lisp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had Julie give me some feedback on the splash page/dashboard I have been working on. She gave good feedback that I was able to use to refine it a bit. I think she was a little afraid of hurting my feelings though but she shouldn&amp;#8217;t be, we are married after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only pushed out the layout changes and the changes to the latest post. I still need to figure out where the weather widget(s) will go and how they will behave (as tabs or as content areas that dynamically expand when the user is interested in them. I am not sure. I also need to spend some time updating the categories and making sure they are all posted in in the right category. Categories will also need to be changed a bit so that they are all capitalized. The other thing I was going to do with cats is to make several main categories like Outdoors (or Computers, Home, Cars, ) that all of the riding, hiking stuff can go under, then it will rise to the top of the top category&amp;#8217;s script when those links are generated. Maybe I write my ideas down and have my better&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah signed &amp;#8216;horse&amp;#8217; for me the other day. The only thing is she thinks all harses are called &amp;#8216;BoBo&amp;#8217;.
Other stuff: got the lights taken down and the truck running today. It&amp;#8217;s prolly not the fuel pump. Maybe the cold start sensor? I&amp;#8217;ll need to do some more googling to see what the internets say.
Other things to do: finish the script to grep out five images from the blog images.</description>
