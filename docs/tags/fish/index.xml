      <description>Hannah helped me pick out some new fish last night. Mr. Fishy died a few weeks ago when the tank had an oxygenation issue.
Since it was book club night Hannah and I had Mac n&amp;#8217; Cheese and then went to the pet store. She looked at all the fish but was more interested in the cats. She didn&amp;#8217;t want to choose I guided her into the Black Mollies and the Neon Tetras.</description>
