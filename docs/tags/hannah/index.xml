      <description>Ah, morning coffee and a nice walk over to the clubhouse. Much better today than yesterday; I was warmer and I felt better. I have about a hundred pictures posted to Google+ that I shared with Family and Friends. Let me know if you can&amp;#8217;t find them.
These are my favorite pictures of the morning.

      <title>Epic Powder Day</title>

      <description>It was most certainly out of the ordinary. And she wanted to go faster while yelling at me to let her do it on her own ðŸ™‚
It was almost as much work as riding the park and the pipe or carving out heelside turns that compliment the toeside. It was more fun than I have ever had on the slopes and I returned home a very proud papa.
At least equal to being hip deep in powder on a double black diamond above the treeline and more fulfilling than turning my first frontside 360.</description>

      <description>I put my bindings on the new snowboard. It&amp;#8217;s light! I think. I have big plans for the t6.
Hannah is getting smart, strategic almost. She asks set up questions anticipating what my answer will be. Then she follows up with what she really wants.</description>

      <description>Last night was Halloween. Hannah was a Ladybug, and a very cute one at that.
She was a little funny at the Halloween party. I am not sure if it is because she fell off Bobo (Totally her parental units fault), the lack of a nap or something else. At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&amp;#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her.</description>
