      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The book starts off with a great line:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DECIDE WHATS NEXT IN YOUR LIFE AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO GET IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if strategize is a word but the idea is both powerful and subtle. We always tell each other our greatest wants, if only. Most of my if only&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t require huge amounts of money. More than money they require time and flexibility. Ask a meterologist to predict the next snow storm he can&amp;#8217;t do it, not with high accuracy. He can run the models, know the climate and the different types of weather patterns; but they are wrong more often that they are right because weather is random, truly unpredictable. The storms never hit exactly when they are supposed to, they never have as much or as little as they are supposed to. As in Life. So if i can&amp;#8217;t predict whats next and life is random, how do I get my &amp;#8216;If only&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s convenient for me?&amp;#8217;
