      <description>If I tell someone that I will call them next week, I should call them. If I don&amp;#8217;t, all I will be is the guy who can&amp;#8217;t keep his word.
Maybe that matters and maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t. If you run in to me down the road before you remember anything else about me, i&amp;#8217;ll bet you remember me as the guy who didn&amp;#8217;t call you back when I said I would.</description>
