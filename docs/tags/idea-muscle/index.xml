      <description>I came across PadMapper.com on Hacker News and being in the market took a look. I liked what I saw, being in the market there is not much to like about the real estate industry. From the way they federate their data and make it as hard as possible for their customers to find what they are looking for, to the cumbersome option selection they provide.
What I liked about PadMappers UI is this:</description>
