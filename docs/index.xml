      <description>It says more about congress than Facebook that the American congress has a childish understanding of computers, networks and algorithms. They are woefully uneducated and inarticulate when it comes to discussing the technical aspects of data and Facebook and how the two impact the social fabric.
Watching senator after senator ask questions that clearly demonstrate this lack of understanding on a fundamental level I&amp;#8217;m left with the question, are they even qualified to bring legislation that will address the social impacts that data collection by corporations has on society?</description>

      <description>I am struggling to get back into my morning routine. Even though I know its good for me its been a struggle for the past few weeks to get up and get going. Part of it is me. I am a creature of habit and routine. Get me off my routine and it seems like everything has fundamentally changed and it takes cycles to get back on.
Maybe telling myself that I will do it is enough.</description>

      <description>I saw this ina stream and wanted to write it down. Marked as a todo in that I want to distill it into a less verbose list of action items.
A team composed of several specialists (doctors, anthropologists, demographers, nutritionists, epidemiologists) – and led by Dan Buettner himself – travelled many times to the different blue zones. They identified the following nine general longevity factors, which are related to diet and lifestyle:</description>

      <description>I need to establish a new routine that lets me make progress on my personal goals.&amp;nbsp;
Every week I need to review and document myself.&amp;nbsp;
First, I need to commit to those nebulous goals that roll around in my head. The things I’ll do someday and the ideas that I can visualize with a hazy lack of clarity but keep floating to the surface.&amp;nbsp;
From the Principles book:
 Have clear goals.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Why do you run from them?&amp;#8221; she asks him. A simple question with an answer like all answers &amp;#8211; more complicated the the deeper you get under the surface of what&amp;#8217;s obvious. The human psyche is a hall full of smoke and mirrors. Even when we choose the right path we are lucky more often than we are right.&amp;nbsp;
The question that he poses back to her is apt enough to catch her attention.</description>

Luddite comes close but its not quite right. I hate that. I hate that some of those comments are from friends and family who are good people and when I engage with them its an unproductive conversation about apples and oranges. But, I hate what the whiney and grumpy old man in the white house did yesterday on many, many levels so I&amp;#8217;m going to make some observations hereFirst about. I hope at the very least you can *try* to understand where I am coming from. &lt;/span&gt;

      <description>Even if its just a suburban ranch its still full of life and lessons and hard work. Surviving is more than just showing up. Thriving is more than waiting for nice pleasant things to show up.&amp;nbsp;
Having a plan. Sticking to it and chipping away at the mou Taib of work are two keys to fulfilling a dream come true on the urban ranch.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>with the #weather and other #fakenews.&amp;nbsp;

I could use some of this flavor of comedy after hearing about all of the fake news this week. The rules have changes for sure.&amp;nbsp;
It seems like they are the same as last time around. Same as they always are.&amp;nbsp;
 It starts with me and I don&amp;#8217;t take critique well. I struggle with shutting my mouth long enough for the rational part of my brain to separate the intel I have been given from the emotional response that desperately wants to leap from my mouth.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve found that I think&amp;nbsp;I know things and even more dangerous, I think I do &amp;nbsp;things. Like read something that makes sense and make sure it&amp;#8217;s legit. Or when someone says a numerical figure in conversation it I go verify it.&amp;nbsp;
I heard a podcast a whole back and it was about an issue with per reviewed research. The gist of it was that most research only gets done once because the grant money is in novel research.</description>

      <description>I am testing myself on some personal learning topics and here are my Q &amp;amp; A&amp;#8217;s. Underlined words indicate an area I need to investigate and understand better. Study was mainly done here
WHAT IS TREE TRAVERSAL? Tree traversal in this context is the programmatic visitation to nodes in a tree. In my mind is a BST with data and left and right pointers. The process that a program uses to visit and perform computation on the trees nodes is tree traversal.</description>

      <description>Anyone can be a leader and everyone should lead something. We are all professionals and experts at the things we do most.
From what I see, the best leaders are always learning. They ask questions, teach them selves new things and effectively identify those in the next generation with the most fearless voices. The ones who are optimistic that anything can happen. Anything at all.&amp;nbsp;
As a parent I struggle to ride the line between efficiency and wading through all of the noise that my next generation emits and letting her explore and broadcast her way to where I need her to be.</description>

I probed a bit because it was obvious to me that the matchine was faster and more efficient at mixing the food coloring into the frosting. &amp;#8220;It does it to fast she said.</description>

      <description>Your Problem So you have a link thats a phone number. You have this because you want the link to auto dial when on a phone but look like text and not have any functionality when on a screen larger than a phone. As an engineer you don&amp;#8217;t want to duplicate html to provide this feature and would love if css had a way to encapsulate this on one place.</description>

      <description>Hannah and I carved pumpkins today while Julie managed us. I had to turn off the helicopter parental instincts and let her rip on the horse. She shreds pretty well and did it all herself.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>You can never escape your past and sometimes it gives you a happy return. Hannah found an old Ohio flag in my closet. I think it&amp;#8217;s from college but can&amp;#8217;t be sure.&amp;nbsp;
She had all kinds of questions why did I have it. Where was it from and what was it for and could she hand it up somewhere. When she stopped to take a breath I told her that I thought it was a great idea.</description>

      <description>I have always loved good music. I&amp;#8217;ve heard some good songs of this time and I still love it when I come across timeless lyrics like this:
 Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
pour another glass of that rock and roll
 I&amp;#8217;m a long way from the mid 90&amp;#8217;s Cleveland metal scene. &amp;nbsp;Boy! Man o man did it train my ear to find the good sounds in the sonically oversaturated internet world of 2015.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web is an infinite canvas. Anyone can create a page with a bit of html and even make it look nice with some css. Word processors are infinite canvases &amp;#8211; just open up a new page and you can write whatever you want to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoid The Hard Line</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to take a stand. You feel that you have no choice but to &amp;#8216;draw a line in the sand.&amp;#8217; This line is a dangerous thing. As with all things of last resort it can inflict as much damage on yourself as it can those whom you are trying to protect yourself from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall  when Gandalf broke the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers&#34;&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/a&gt;, it did not end well for him. But he saved his friends and things worked out. I like this, its ideal but if I have learned anything these past years is that the &lt;strong&gt;real world and the ideal one inside my head have very little in common. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A whiskey infused customer support request to try and get iTunes movie rentals to work on my aging iPad mini mini. &amp;nbsp;-MattH
 Let&amp;#8217;s get a few thing onto the table. This is not the first time I&amp;#8217;ve had this problem. But, I am the typical white male American from rural enough America who made it well enough off to be able to complain about first world problems. Heck, the fact that I get to complain from my first gen iPad mini is evidence enough to of my entitlement.</description>

      <description>Here is an odd turn of events. I have been saving for a nice pair of headphones (Shure 535&amp;#8217;s) and decided to get a mini amp (Fiio &amp;#8211; Mont Blanc) since phone&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t have the power to do them justice.
The amp is nicely crafted with brushed aluminum for its enclosure. To turn it on and control volume there is a knob with a rough but pleasant to touch texture. It has a satisfying click and I find myself envying the control over volume more than with the rockers on the phones that I have used since as long as my memory goes back for that kind of thing.</description>

      <description>I have been having issues with my trackpad and bluetooth keyboard reconnecting to after I wake up from a sleep session. Only twice now but the same thing. Instead of restarting (which will fix it) you can drop into the command line and run these two commands:
  sudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport
  sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport

      <description>I believe that we all have ideas. Some good, some different and some that are meh. Together we can assemble ideas that can solve the biggest of problems. These pieces of the puzzle are more difficult to mine than diamonds and gold but are infinitely more valuable when we put them together in a variety of ways with other ideas from like minded folks.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a weird layout issue with the Bootstrap 3 Grid this morning. After three attempts that ended in failure, on way or the other I was something. Frustrated, pissed, annoyed are words that come close to the feeling, but they are not quite right. English is a funny language and sometimes not quite descriptive enough for the more subtle emotions that wash over you from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a break. On the Twitter I saw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/the-quitter&#34;&gt;Virgin twitter feed post&lt;/a&gt; to this. It helped 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Early morning thought for more exploration at some point:
Go right up to the line. Study it, learn about its history and why its where it is at that moment. Then, press your index finger up against it and see how it responds. Is it stretchy and membrane like? is it porous or brittle? Does it deliver an electric shock to your system? You won&amp;#8217;t know if you never try to cross the line.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have heard that some are worried that there is all this really important data hidden in spreadsheets and tied to an app and an OS. And that data may not be parsible in fifty or a hundred years. And that may be so. But, our knowledge is still passed on in the oral tradition. And now it&amp;#8217;s an easily persists or audio visual tradition. It&amp;#8217;s funny, how the more things change, technology, the more they stay the same, good story telling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Casualty of the mass production scalable economy. In that, things aren&amp;#8217;t made to last as long as they could be with a bit more cost and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self, it&amp;#8217;s the extra effort that sets you apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Programming is the part of engineering where you design a machine that will accomplish a goal. These machines can be built to accomplish a range of related goals.
The accomplishment of many goals, this is your application or service. Avoid building the service to fit the people using it. Build it and evolve it to fit the accomplishments.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three quotes from the (Audio) book: &lt;a href=&#34;http://makeitstick.net&#34;&gt;Make It Stick:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourages deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its better to attempt a solution and supply an incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>Thoughts from Hannah on 12-17-2014
 My favorite part of the story was when the reindeer nudged Teeka on the cheek. This was my favorite part of the story, because I would like to have a nudge from a reindeer. If I were Teeka, I would be really nice to the reindeer all the time. If I were one of the reindeer I would listen to Teeka all the time.</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-it-stick-the-science-of-successful-learning&#34;&gt;Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a book about recent advances in understanding the science of learning and questions some of the assumptions you may have. This stands out since I seem to have started 2015 off with an understanding and using failure theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful learners who interpret failure to learn something as the result of insufficient effort or an ineffective strategy will more often dig deeper by asking more questions and using what the learn to try different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>No, not the band. But I do hope they put a new album out this year.
Failure as in, &amp;#8216;define my success by the things I have failed trying to do.&amp;#8217;
Failure as in, &amp;#8216;if I have not failed at something today, then I&amp;#8217;m not challenging myself.&amp;#8217;
Failure as is, &amp;#8216;we grow and learn the most when we struggle and fail to easily succeed at something.&amp;#8217;
Forget failing fast. Just try many things and plan to fail at most of them.</description>

Baldy is collecting snow it made sense to me that that was the right pack of gum for me. They have a marketing gimmick for truth or dare and these two truth questions stood out for me:
 Question:
Would you rather fly or drive across the country?
Answer:
Drive &amp;#8211; its more scenic, less stressful than airports and only has the con of needing to make personal time to do it.</description>

 What, you think because you&amp;#8217;re paying Apple that you&amp;#8217;re somehow in alignment with them?
 Despite the admiration that has grown on me wrt how Facebook is lead and some of the things they are doing, my opinion of a company built solely around advertising is not based on how I think I align with them. It&amp;#8217;s how I think they align with me.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t know who said it when I was growing up, but, it has held true for me as I walk along this path.  “Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.”  There are many places that it could have come from. See here for more info.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Glossly was an urbanized mecca for billions of hipster rolly pollies. Poky was a little town where life balance is in harmony with the natural state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asking the wrong question is expensive. It eats up time, creates unintended problems with cascading consequences and exhausts your energy. We are looking at appetizing our themes at work. Our themes are simple angular apps that depend on a toolbox of things related to the api, business logic and the desire to provide some out of the box components that just work. For the uninitiated Angular developer this lets them focus on the style and presentation of the app and spend time where they are more comfortable, with the scss (or css if they nee to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest digital virus going around the internets caught up with me this past weekend and team Mack tagged me as one of their &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; So, I had my lovely assistant help me with the challenge and with her advice I pass it on to Barbi, Jasmine and Raquelle. Good thing it was warm and pleasant here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy cold showers but this was more like a polar bear swim. I think Hannah enjoyed pouring the H2O over my head though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs on problem solving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don’t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it’s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s sort of the middle, and that’s where most people stop… But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem — and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>From Anatidae&amp;#8217;s comment on the web:
  If you&amp;#8217;re messing with the DOM, do it in a directive If you&amp;#8217;re modifying your data, do it in your controllers or services.  If you&amp;#8217;re defining data, do it in a factory.   Also, the faster you forget about jQuery, the faster you will be productive building an Angular app. You can always bring it back later if you still want to and you may run into in in disguise in one of your directives.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Revolutionary gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary keeps you moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what, you think different. So does everyone else. If we all think different, all the time there will be billions of little revolutions that spark, flare up and flame out. The flare ups that evolve into consuming a fuel source are the ones that change everything. They transform the landscape as they go through their lifecycle. Everything has a lifecycle: businesses, ideas and organisms alike. &amp;#8220;Whatever it is, we all go through it&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latyrx&#34;&gt;Latyrix&lt;/a&gt; (I think)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Focus, and stay perfectly still.
Focus, calm your mind.
Rest your body. And go to sleep. A smile does wonders for the reception of my delivery.  Lay down still.
Close your eyes, and rest.
Your mind. Sleep.</description>

&lt;p&gt;No, not this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping&#34;&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt;. Well not at the technical level I would expect to find myself at. It strikes me as odd that this is not more urgent for me. We have all the tools to, whats the phrase, turn the tables? Close, but not quite right. While fully acknowledging the inherit risks we should embrace the ability of our devices to track stuff. We can use it to our advantage, with a little help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are guidelines to everything under the sun. Getting what you want, where you want, how you want is just another process that we all go through. It can always be done differently but the savvy folks learn to look at the lessons learned by those who traveled before them and apply their lessons appropriately. These are guidelines. With that said, Keep these in mind when you are designing your path:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The answer we seek is not always obvious. As we grow and gain experience we become skilled in sussing out the easy answers. But what about when it&amp;#8217;s hard? When the path is not as well traveled?
Walk on soldier. Persevere and gain the victors spoils for they are well worth the price you must pay.
 &amp;#8230;the willingness to explore the least likely pathways is important for often there can be no other reason for exploring such pathways.</description>

In more detail and for faster reference in the future, here are the JavaScript Primitives as I know them. More details and fun facts can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects&#34;&gt;Global Objects&lt;/a&gt; page of the mozilla developer documentation site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are giving our gold away with the sand and pebbles as we watch the breadcrumbs of our digital lives float down the river of life. We need a sieve and nets that we control. Who cares what they do. Clearly it&amp;#8217;s not illegal and the shareholders seem happy, if fickle. What those folks do does not concern me. What you do does. You have already given it all away, take some back for yourself. For your future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to program, learn how to break shit first. Some tools (git) make it easy to break. Eventually, once you break enough shit, someone who knows you can break will challenge you. Challenge you to fix something that someone else broke or address a problem that has never been solved but holds them back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If I found a pot of gold I would be happy for my family. First I would get a puppy. Next I&amp;#8217;d get a phone. Then I&amp;#8217;d get a house. I&amp;#8217;d get a water bottle. Last I&amp;#8217;d get a mechanical pencil. I would like to have a pot of gold.&amp;#8221; [read more for picture]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Summary Of The Doodle Book</title>

      <description>I finished the Doodle Revolution book this morning by Sunni Brown. Overall it taught me that questions are about systems, processes or comparisons (sometimes comparing one system or process to another). These questions lead to meetings with communication, understanding (or lack thereof) and ideas. The addition of those three things lead to answers.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;customization-is-diy&#34;&gt;Customization Is DIY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a custom shelf and didn&amp;#8217;t think any of the usual suspects would have something like I wanted in the price range I wanted. So I&amp;#8217;m going to make my own. Like cooking, the more I do for myself the closer I get to what I want. Perhaps this is because economies of scale must make compromises and I have to make compromises when I dim (do it myself). It&amp;#8217;s just that I can supply the skill and choose which compromises I care about most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I like doing art with Hannah. She thinks I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing. All I do is fallback on the things I know and make the rest up as I go along.
Chalk is my favorite medium to play outside together with her.</description>

And I hope today was good
Full of summer fun
  Life is a cycle and this is something I used to say to Hannah when she let me walk her into the schoolyard. The sketch was an idea I jotted down about how to visualize life in a personal context.     We start our cycles and learn whats fun and not fun.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about why I don&amp;#8217;t want my apps to make me think. I&amp;#8217;m there to do a job and move on. If I have to change this, fix that or connect to the network because the app forgot that it just got the data for this screen a minute ago before I switched apps to check my calendar; then the app is making me do more mental work than I budgeted for the task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are other things. But tonight the camera in my pocket is worth priceless.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had neglected the editor setup on my personal laptop for a while. The only thing that was even close was emacs because I really like org-mode as catch all for things that I want to version control and drag around with me. At work I had started to really like Sublime Text 2 but didn&amp;#8217;t know until after I bought it that it was going away and the license doesn&amp;#8217;t count for ST3. Oh well, I can live with ST2 until it dies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zumbox is winding down and I&amp;#8217;m iterating through updated versions of my resume and cover letter. I&amp;#8217;ve been testing the water around TO this week and there are opportunities for sure. Doing the new browser client in AngularJS was very fortuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to take an Angular path to some more JS enlightenment* &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-My-Experience-With-AngularJS-The-Super-heroic-JavaScript-MVW-Framework.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s highs for me were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope, $scope and direct binding to the DOM elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directives as reusable widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory services with the builder pattern for extending an objects functionlity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaYaaq2Miw&#34;&gt;Promises, Promises&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://taoofcode.net/promise-anti-patterns/&#34;&gt;Promise Anti-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still going up (and down 🙂 ) &amp;#8211; every time I drop into the angular source code to trace or debug issues I am treated to a mind expanding experience. And it&amp;#8217;s very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Design A Tall (JavaScript) Function</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-design-a-tall-javascript-function&#34;&gt;How to design a (tall JavaScript) function:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&#34;&gt;https://class.coursera.org/programdesign-002/wiki/HtDFModule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching the video for &amp;#8220;Design a function to determine if an image is tall.&amp;#8221; and using the tall-starter.rkt in DrRacket. As an exercise I transposed it into JavaScript with the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must get a working prototype as fast as possible (10 minutes or less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test it my own ad hoc way since jasmine/karma/protractor are libraries/frameworks and not native to browsers
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>I was laying a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. My constraints were:
&amp;#8211; grid like structure
&amp;#8211; on a cork board medium
&amp;#8211; one center of focus
&amp;#8211; even (ish) distribution
&amp;#8211; minimum effort today
Physically doing the layout made me wish I had css3 or iOS auto layout to assist and tweak. It only took four tries ( including previous prototypes ) with some help from my two trusty assistants to get it the way I wanted it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder, should my app have pretty dead end points so that my user can find them self somewhere or with something that looks cool, pleases the eye with shiny distractions and does nothing function related to the app but entertains and delights and takes their mind down an unintended path for a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my new Xmas toys was a stylus that has pressure sensitivity and other things available if the app developer implements it. It talks Bluetooth and unfortunately wacom decided to use aaaa batteries to power it. No store in the area carry them and all the shady sellers on amazon ( shady because they send them without being in original packaging even though they picture them as such. About half of the reviewers received dead or expired batteries ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I found myself replying to a conversation thread online and thought it was worth saving.
 Do you plan on having children? Will your grandchildren&amp;#8217;s grandchildren wonder where they came frome and what it was like?
If only I could query the daily activities and conversations of my great grandparents or query thousands of photos and movies for people, places and moments that my have been talked about when I was a child.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about an issue I need to solve for myself I started thing about all things free. Most things online are free, supported with marketing. All it requires is acceptance of Terms &amp;amp; Conditions be they what they may. This causes a problem. Not for me or you but for our grandchildren&amp;#8217;s grandchildren. They will never be able to access the accounts we blindly use with out thinking about the long term view and our relationship with the data we all create. I am company agnostic in this regard: they are all guilty of manipulation human nature for profit. And thats ok, for now. But what about my information a hundred years from now? The corporations won&amp;#8217;t care. I hope and try to parent to create a future generation that will care about the things I have learned and things that shaped and guided me and provided the vibrant color in my life. And if they do, how will the get glimpses of that color? Understand how some things in a hundred years are different to the point of alienation yet others remain as constant as the mountain top that beckons me to walk up and ride down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

1) The Story that has need rolling around my head all these years ( mashulg, silent guild &amp;amp; the mellonheads)
2) The Song that exists only in my head and when I play it for Hannah AND the Xmas song for next year with extempore
3) The Images &amp;#8211; the pictures that complement both The Story and The Song need to graduate from doodles into finished files.</description>

      <description>I had a minor issue this morning with my work computer. It&amp;#8217;s set up with OSX Mavericks and I use two external monitors. The most anticipated feature I was looking for was the real support for full screen modes on multiple monitors and I have been making heavy use of it. Since I work in a PCI compliant environment I have a five minute time out that locks the system and also requires a password when waking up.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Procreate more and more. It is steadily replacing Paper by 53 as my go to app to sketch, mock or doodle. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s the weird tone the support staff takes in papers forums (and the sad we&amp;#8217;re just like Apple and we know what&amp;#8217;s best for you attitude; without even knowing why Apple can get away with it and they can&amp;#8217;t) or the Pro part of Procreate: a free downloadable book for the manual, layers and I can import things into the app to draw on top of.</description>

      <description>A post from a notebook that I kept :
&amp;nbsp;
There is no such thing as comfortable.
Success is:
 Self contained Focus Conviction Hardcore with a twist of funk Handstands Trust no one &amp;#8211; Hey, why should I? Trust is earned. Not being a scapegoat. Ever. For yourself, your failures or someone else&amp;#8217;s.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I was thinking back then but I was listening to a lot of Mushroomhead (Carefule here unless you still really like metal, I stopped following them so close around 2004) and Unified Culture at the time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning Hannah and I did some glitter art. It was inspired by her &amp;#8216;discovery&amp;#8217; of some packets of glitter I found while cleaning the garage last weekend. She &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217; them on my workbench in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each took charge of one paper but helped each other decorate and gave advice on the art direction for the others project. I&amp;#8217;ll leave it up to you to guess who&amp;#8217;s is who&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, clone an existing project, don&amp;#8217;t inherit a project from github thats actively developed by someone smarter than you instead of an overseas contractor who was also learning Angular for the first time 😉&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sonic Cycles</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2013-08-25-sonic-cycles/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2013-08-25-sonic-cycles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything is tied to a cycle, a rhythm and the beat of someones drum. Things pulse and we are drawn to them in unison. Be it music, be it it code (hardware &amp;amp; software) be it a summer festival in the sun. We are all drawn to the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, music is the light and  I&amp;#8217;m just a fan of anything good. I grew up in northeastern Ohio with the heavy metal hard rock that was really, really fun in the nineties along the Cuyahoga River. Then, Lake Erie and the flats were a great place to experience music and pure Rock &amp;amp; Roll. And then Lallapalooza &amp;#8217;91 came into town and blew my mind. It expand all of the possibilities to the next level that led me to where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Those Old Shoes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sent this into &lt;a href=&#34;https://uncommon.cc&#34;&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;. They ask nice questions. Here is my answer to this one: **Is there something you&amp;#8217;ve lost that you&amp;#8217;ve never forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was three, maybe four years old in northeastern Ohio on an autumn afternoon. My parents made us rake up the leaves one afternoon. It was one of those magical afternoons. Where the sunlight filters down through the mature forest and motes of dust hang between oaks, silver maples and beech trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my shoes off, like I still do. There is nothing like the feeling of green grass and crunchy leaves underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&#34;&gt;JIRA&lt;/a&gt; this morning and it tried to think for me. A few months ago we switched to JIRA issue tracking at work. ANd it is miles ahead of the disjointed system we were using before. Still, it tried to think for me to make things easier I assume. It didn&amp;#8217;t get it right and ended up leading me down a path that caused me to re-do about five minutes of working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution is Migration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In life, everything evolves. Not quite the same as the Darwinian definition of the word but its a close metaphor. But, in the small, learning and adapting behavior to take advantage of knowledge sense of the word. That&amp;#8217;s why animals, people included, migrate. Birds go where it&amp;#8217;s warmer and the food is easy. People migrate around various web properties because they find value for their time there. Then a new shiny service starts up and they migrate again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is about tools. Not the scary old dude at the Katie Perry concert by himself or the harmoniously awesome band. My tools. The same ones you might use if you decide to make something similar things that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, about a year ago I started down a new path. I thought it was the same old path I had ridden a thousand times before. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t. It was different. The opportunity was different and I knew that by the time the interview ended and they had had good, thoughtful answers for most of my questions. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next user interface will combine motion with action. Most of the &amp;#8216;action&amp;#8217; will be spoken in the way an executive gives orders to the minions. Copy this, save that and put the other thing over there, oh yeah, when I finish this, remind me to do the other thing before I get distracted by shinty Internet things. All desired actions will  be spoken aloud in conversation. You know people like me whom in the middle of a problem talk it through. Yeah, these additions to ourinterface will be great for us. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From what I hear the tooth fairy has increased her rates so I guess I should invest in some iTunes gift cards.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe she is moving on from kindergarten. It seems like the long days of home work and coordinating drop offs, pickups and school events coalesce into a brief moment that passes by while I was blinking.
Now she can read, to me. Now she can do math, well adding and subtracting. Now she has bff&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; although they are quite dynamic. Now she can dress herself for uniform days or free dress days and she knows better than info what the rules are.</description>

      <description>I sometimes use my site as a file transfer mechanism. It&amp;#8217;s easier or email services do silly things and make it hard to transfer files in an easy way. I don&amp;#8217;t use dropbox and googles drive is more cumbersome than $scp filename.zip to my hose. With my ssh keys in place its trivial to put the file where I need it to go.
I schedule an automated backup script to backup my site and its databases every month.</description>

      <description>A reoccurring theme in any business is the marketing and &amp;#8216;systematic&amp;#8217; communication that needs to take place between a company and a customer. I have been working on something like this during the past sprint. Except that even with a complex system it is still manual to update the content, ie the message. Further complicating this is that as undesirable (IMO) as email is, it is still a requirement for customer outreach.</description>

      <description>I started putting thought online and figured that was it. It would be easy to make it look good and easy to write well. Double ha on both of those. The writing is slightly easier (when I do it regularly) if I write, rewrite and then rewrite it two more times. It helps to regularly read E.B White and Strunk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;The Elements of Style.&amp;#8217;
The look and feel of the site is harder, sure there are free and paid themes for WordPress but tweaking them only gets you so far.</description>

      <description>These days I spend more time in Xcode with Objective-C than the web application part of my world. However the API needs to talk to the iOS app so I jump back into that world intermittently. I used to think JavaScript was my strongest language and that PHP was second.
No more! Today i modified the Objective-C code that interfaces to the API in a fraction of the time it took me to figure out how to change the API for this particular issue.</description>

      <description>They say that its the little things that kill. The straw that breaks the camels back.
Conversely it is the little things the make large efforts worthwhile. A hand on your shoulder and a word of encouragement; a well timed challenge to make it keep going, The power we have in our every day lives to influence begins and depends on the little things we do. I see this as a father.</description>

      <description>Hannah had lots of fun at the Pincrest jump rope for the heart. They she has been using mine because the first one we got her didn&amp;#8217;t work as good as mine.
Yesterday we picked her out a new one and today she got a second one from school. Attached to it was this plane. She did the assembly all by herself on the ride home from school. Last Sunday I got to show her how the Volvo brakes come apart and go back together.</description>

      <description>I worked on a project with Hannah this week. We had to design and implement a Leprechaun trap that she could assemble at school. We were constrained to using materials found at home and that could be assembled at school.
We had two designs. The first, using an empty tissue box, was inspired by the raccoon traps in the book &amp;#8216;Where the Red Fern Grows.&amp;#8217; The trapping idea was that we would put something shiny in it.</description>

When we moved I found a bunch of journal entries I made over the years. It&amp;#8217;s interesting. There is a lot of silly things. Although I&amp;#8217;m putting this online in 2012, I&amp;#8217;m putting the original publish date when it was written.</description>

      <description>Teaching Hannah how to run her iPod touch was easy, I just had to play with the settings and shines noises. Then when I take a picture of it, she tells me to wait. And she asks me how to resign the keyboard from the screen.
So when she steps on her first digital stones and wants to move them around, i can only smile and agree.</description>

      <description>Letting go is the hardest parental job to do. Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &amp;#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&amp;#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me.</description>

      <description>Tried to set up a Hangout for family in different states. For regular users of google plus not an issue. For users who logged in a while ago and set everything up just after the service went public not so much. Here is what I noticed on Christmas AM while trying to help them and watch my daughter open her gifts from Santa.
 Plugins are horrible for ux &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s why we just had them revert to FaceTime, it never asks you to install anything.</description>

Just the bare skeleton for now. Thats easy and I can do it in a few minutes with AM coffee. WHile I still like the old theme, it was purchased from ThemeForest over two years ago and it is showing its age in web years.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not the algorithmic kind, the real kind. The kind of sorting that was around long before even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism&#34;&gt;first computer&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, perhaps I had some coins. Coins used to be a popular way to facilitate exchanges. So there we were back when this ancient computer was built. But we didn&amp;#8217;t care about  the computer. I had coins, you had beans, lets talk and make an exchange. Being competitive, I wanted as many of your beans for as few of my coins as possible. And thats where sorting comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>She was born in the California desert and we first met her on our way to Vegas. She was sweet and wiggled alot and had the most beautiful golden colored eyes I ever did see.
She made the trip to Colorado in ought six and then back again this spring. Bouncy and always full of life, even when she was being a little bitchy or taunting horses and cows in the pasture.</description>

      <description>Ah, morning coffee and a nice walk over to the clubhouse. Much better today than yesterday; I was warmer and I felt better. I have about a hundred pictures posted to Google+ that I shared with Family and Friends. Let me know if you can&amp;#8217;t find them.
These are my favorite pictures of the morning.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;#8217;s not a new drug. As we get Bobo ready to travel, we had a few things checked out. You know the things that you have happened and seemed little or odd but have corrected themselves with some rest a time? We have noticed Bobo being sore since Decemberish. I think that was that last time I remember Julie riding him. He has always been sore after being trimmed and there have been a few times when he was to sore to ride. So when the vet that did his Coggins test and other things said he was worried about foundering Julie took notice. Me, I don&amp;#8217;t know much about what that means as I married into horses and am learning as I go. Here are my notes about High Ringbone and what is means for Mr. Bobo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning the farrier, who gave me an excellent crash course into the physics of horse hoof anatomy, told me that he suspected Bobo had arthritis and it was causing High ringbone &amp;#8211; in my layman and unscientific terms is ossification around the top of his pastern bones that causes spurs to form in the front and on the sides where the joint&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I came across PadMapper.com on Hacker News and being in the market took a look. I liked what I saw, being in the market there is not much to like about the real estate industry. From the way they federate their data and make it as hard as possible for their customers to find what they are looking for, to the cumbersome option selection they provide.
What I liked about PadMappers UI is this:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I friend has been talking about how he wants to use gameification at his employer. One Saturday morning, over coffee I logged into &lt;a href=&#34;http://duolingo.com&#34;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;.com and showed him their interface and demonstrated the elements of gamification in it. Since then they have made several notable enhancements. The most notible technique they use is the owl, Duo. He?She? is pretty cute and expressive enough in response to what I do on the site that I feel something as I interact with the software. When I get busy and the two practice sessions build up I feel guilty because Duo will cry. Ok, not that guilty but enough that I will consciously decide to make time to at least crank through the practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the levels that one can earn by doing lessons and translating real websites. So I can level up and as time has gone on I can follow others and see how I compare &amp;#8211; not in a competitive way but in a &amp;#8220;Wow, how did they get that many points?&amp;#8221; motivational way. Recently I noticed that they enhanced the translating the real web interface so that I can earn more or less points depending on how difficult the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its a cold dark world. When you find a warm light, even a small flicker cup your hands around it and enjoy the warmth. Nurture it &amp;#8211; if its a candle and the wax is almost gone transfer it to a new candle so it can continue to add light to the world. Science, numbers, logic makes me feel warm because it is easy to internalize ones answer as right or wrong. The answer to the math question is either correct or incorrect or, the function you write has the correct output that you need or it doesn&amp;#8217;t. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter how you got to the correct output. For most things in life and business, it only matters that you got to the correct answer for a particular problem. Solving any kind of problem &amp;#8211; even small and trivial ones always makes me feel warm inside and adds flicker to my flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have found myself in an odd position with a problem I am uneducated for and unprepared to solve. Selling my skill set and experience to a range of businesses with unique problems regarding the internet. I like the web and I want to work with web technology to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You don&amp;#8217;t need to have aws accounts, you can use the file system but you don&amp;#8217;t know this until you start going through the site setup after the software, db and web server are nicely talking. In my case I got an answer on the irc channel.

      <title>Biggest iOS Improvement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that the updated messaging get a lot of press after the last iOS update. And it is good, from what I have seen Julie do with it. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to wait a bit longer to get some more experience with it when the iPhone 5 comes out. While I still think the webOS did notifications much better they improved it too. If they could only figure out a way to get webOS notifications and something close to the synergy sync that made contact management so painless on webOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this ins&amp;#8217;t about any of that, it is the biggest thing. On the coolness factoer scale the touchstone was by far the coolest thing, not just because of the nice magnet charging base. I think the wireless sync that the last iOS upgrade included is on par with that. Hannah got a new Barbie movie on DVD last weekend. So I ripped it on my laptop and transfered the file over to the mini hooked up to the tv that is used to sync the iOS devices of my to lovely ladies. Once it was on there and copied into Julies iTUnes library it was trivial to push&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying to sleep in the other day. Usually, up and at &amp;#8217;em by 6:30 I was stalling. I think it was related to the time change. I have never been a fan of it and it throws everything off for a few days. Even Hannah was up later than usual. I wanted to lay still for a while longer and read some more of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s funny how unconnected things can link together in related ways. Yesterday&amp;#8217;s trip to the Butterfly Pavilion and the free kit in cellophane that Hannah got, kinderart projects and learning about animals and bugs combined witha bit of parental laziness and desire for just a few more minutes of morning quiet time lying still unexpectedly gave me a great present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lie still for a few more moments, we had to convince Hannah to be a bit more autonomous. The easiest way to do this is with the iPad because it is bigger than her touch and the games are more fun on it. &amp;#8220;Hannah, do you want to take the iPad and Whitney into your room for a little while longer?&amp;#8221; When she is not asking me to make pancakes, she&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accepting a job offer from an unknown quantity has many consequences down the line on your career. Good managers/teams/companies will help you build up a network of assets and resources long after have moved up and on in your career. To look out for you long term career goals and aspirations you need to go beyond the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m willing to take any job or position that I am buzzword qualified for.&amp;#8221; You need to identify the best managers/teams and companies that are thinking about their long term vision and understand how new employees fit into that. Here are seven questions I will work into my future interviews for full time employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you interested in Hiring me and what do you know about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers that truly have an interest in hiring the best person for the job will take the time to research their top candidates. They will do a google search for you, check you out on LinkedIn and consider the skills you have that can make their team or organization successful. Uninterested managers will either not consider you a top candidate and be interviewing you to meet an HR requirement or, they will be looking to associate your skills&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have come across several neat JavaScript programs that take advantage of all the CSS3 fun you can do in modern browsers. Each time I see a new one idas go racing through my head. I can do this or that or &amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I got one of those mailer brochures from a credit card company with pretty images and pithy tag lines telling me all about their product. I don&amp;#8217;t need any more credit cards right now. But it did get me thinking, how could I do this on a webpage? So I marked it up with one of Hannah&amp;#8217;s pens into some simple markup for the different pieces on each page and put it on my desk. Then I cleaned the office and tossed it. However, the idea continued to roll around in my head and about a week later I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thestartupofyou.com/&#34;&gt;The Start Up Of You&lt;/a&gt;. I joined the group on LinkedIn. Why not, I have been spending quite a bit of time on there looking for reasonable jobs lately. So it was easy to join and nice to come across variations of ideas in the book as well as intelligent discussion about how to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Easy Toolchain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I learned about tools from my dad. He used to fix everything us kiddos broke around the house and the cars and other engine driven things we used. I remember he had a method that included starting from the problem and working backwards through the solution. I spent alot of time bored out of my mind, holding his tools. Sometimes I was sent to get different tools but usually he brought a couple of different general purpose tools and was able to make due with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its funny, the more I learn about software and software development, even from a web slanted view, it all depends on the tools you use. It depends on the tools that work best with your style. I have been keeping my personal projects and org-mode files under version control at bitbucket with mercurial for a few years now and while not completely immersed in the distributed version control environment, I am drawn to the benefits of it. Namely being able to commit to my repo whenever and whereever I am internt access or no internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit here and try to see what it is that I want I see hazy unfocused shapes moving around in a milky white fog. What is it I need to do and how do I want to get that done? There is more than just the gears behind the clock face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes quite a bit of time to put the shortest bit of delight together. Delight that is fleeting only because of the amount of thought and attention to detail that went into it. Take &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/julie/vday&#34;&gt;cards&lt;/a&gt; for example. No matter where they are found there is far more time in preparing them for consumption that the actual consumption which could only be a few seconds. They comunicate ideas and emotions simply (at least my favorite ones do) and they do it with extreme efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the last card you gave. Most likely, you picked it up at a store, signed your name to it and sent it on its way. Perhaps you took the time to write a more personal note. All of the hard stuff was done for you: which card stock to use, how many colors to use in the graphic design on the front in inside,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I had some issues that affected my productivity with google applications in Chrome I re-configured my system to use native apps for chat, mail and calendar. Overall I like the changes and the trade off is worth it since I do not have to log into my google account 30 times a day. I miss using one browser (especially with the three finger swipe down that shows me all of my tabs) but I still use it for development and other browsing. Seriously I counted the last day and it was 30 times google asked me to log in in chrome so I don&amp;#8217;t mind having all my apps in one place. Oddly, firefox and safari do not have this incessant logging in to google services issue with google services. Weird, I know. But I think I&amp;#8217;ll stick with Safari for my work apps accounts for now and use the native apps with personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my point. I was restoring some music to my itunes library and when I dragged and dropped it onto the itunes application I noticed that instead of asking me to choose and drag to Music or Movies, etc; it just highlighted the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the kiddo bench with tape.&lt;/strong&gt; There was an issue with the Ikea bench after four years of heavy use. Hannah informed us that it broke but she didn&amp;#8217;t break it. As a proactive measure though, she fixed it with tape. How creative I think to myself when we had this conversation. And, how awesome to get to witness that comprehension, observe her growth in understanding. Maybe it is just me but the observational apsect of being a parent is fascinating. As for Hannah, she knows tape is sticky and that one can tape things together. The bench needs something sticky to keep it securely on. That makes sense. If I knew what she knows I think I would do the same. Of all the things I ever thought were cool, this is up there as the coolest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decorate the fish tank.&lt;/strong&gt; There was a morning tummy ache yesterday. Julie stayed home with H but still had to do some work stuff. I guess she was on a conference call when Hannah decorated the fish tank. There is tha card we got from John and Lori after Grugi died and some kinderart to start with.

      <title>Un Using Chrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gave up on using chrome for google apps. Ever since they opened up google+ for public use they changed something about the authentication system and my computer running chrome really does not like it. It makes me log in to each app multiple times per day. Intermittently I would get the you must enable javascript or clearn you cache and cookies blah blah blah. Well its been several months and JavaScript has always been enabled. I think my cache and cookies are clear enough to fry an egg on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have even tried to uninstall and re-install but not that the time spent trying to figure out why wants me to log in for each app, multiple time a day it is time to use tool that don&amp;#8217;t get in the way of what I need or want to do and re-logging into a web service multiple times a day is not what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went back to firefox for google plus and the document s. I am going to use apples mail and cal apps for those accounts. I guess the plus side is that I don&amp;#8217;t need to see any of the adds &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This year Hannah had her Holiday concert. She and her class were organized and on tempo with the music. Along with her questions about Santa she is truly beginning to understand the world she moves through. I liked how she fiddled with her antlers, I am sure I ould have done the same if I could have even kept them on my head.
I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my second experience with Fandango I like them even worse. We won&amp;#8217;t focus on the lack of usability on their website but to say that it was less than optimal and more than painful to get the information I was trying to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this sub par experience with them is the Google Offers (I&amp;#8217;m not sold on the whole internet coupons as a value proposition for myself either but Julie is a bit more trusting than I am) Fandango tickets we purchased and can&amp;#8217;t use because they are expiring before we can use them at a different theater later this week. We already made plans to meet other folks at a specific theater but unfortunately for us crapdango tells me that &lt;strong&gt;Online Ticketing Not Available for this Theater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh, so let me get this straight, they sell movie tickets but when I want to buy them they can&amp;#8217;t sell them to me. I recall the first time I balked because they tried to force me to register for an account and charge me an extra couple of dollars for tickets. I guess I&amp;#8217;m at a loss to the value they provide. I have never had a hard time getting tickets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have been struggling with the default install of ffmpeg on centOS5 and went to HandbrakeCLI for easy conversion. However, we need a tool that will convert videos for web (this means x264 and other formats for chrome) and iOS devices.
The stock yum install of ffmpeg on centos (i386) is at 0.6ish. I think its time to upgrade our servers because trying to create webm video is just not working.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was Hannahs first day in the PreK class at primrose. Complete with new jumper uniform and excitement that bounced &amp;#8211; she grows up one milestone at a time and all to fast. When she tries my patience and wants to &amp;#8216;play games&amp;#8217; at 5:15 in the morning it helps me to remember that she won&amp;#8217;t always want me to play with her and these opportunities are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, Julie was trying to take a picture of her but Hannah was being camera shy. I know she missed the cutoff date because of her birthday but something tells me that it is going to be up to me and Julie to keep her interested in learning the things that spark her creativity and interests. With the realization that there is never a good time to raise taxes but the general public doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to understand that you get what you pay for. If we cut budgets and funding for teachers and education we will get what we pay for. While I can vote for things like Colorado&amp;#8217;s prop 103 because I believe in it there isn&amp;#8217;t much I can do to help increase funding for schools. What I can do is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were a few dramatic moments but overall thhings went pretty smoothly and we stopped at Cinzetti&amp;#8217;s Resturaunt for lunch. There is no better place to go with 10+ hungery, sugar overloaded kiddos.</description>

We decorated yet another pumpkin &amp;#8230; I think we should make seeds but have yet to google a good process for cleaning and roasting the seeds. We hit the jumpy spiderman bounce house and talked to some nice people from the neighborhood. Then, some of Hannahs other lilac circle friends showed up and she helped them decorate.</description>

I like that her favorite number is 1. Mine are in no particular order: 11, 19 and 29.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight Hannah and I did LiteBrite instead of reading books for night nights. She sometimes does that &amp;#8230; &amp;#8216;Papa, can we play a game instead of read books tonight?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the drama classes kicked in and she got upset at me. I make deals with her. Tonight the deal was for her to wait in bed for me to come back with my guitar and play her a song after I went to brush my teeth and do shot shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little bunny did not stay in her bed and the deal was off. This was upsetting and I understand. I also understand that we don&amp;#8217;t always get what we want. I think it&amp;#8217;s my job as a parent to teach Hannah that but I&amp;#8217;m not sure. They forgot the manual when were came home with her four years ago. I think that its not just teaching her that we don&amp;#8217;t always get what we want but that when a decision has been made there isn&amp;#8217;t much use crying over it. Has anyone ever been able to teach this to a four year old girl? I don&amp;#8217;t know, me I&amp;#8217;ll just keep chipping away at her subconscious.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cool crisp fall day. The storms of the day before had moved of to the east. We got up early with the sunrise and had a simple breakfast. Toast for me and scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and grilled chicken for you. Sitting around is never good for the soul so we went out to Mr BoBo. Hannah rode in the arena and you and Whitney chased him for a bit, like you always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back home and I took care of a few things around the house. Once I got done I joined you and Whitney out on the deck with my guitar. You sat in the sun the way you always did. Upright on your haunches you enjoyed the view across the valley all the way over to the mountains. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s just boxers but when you sat there stoically and sweetly it just killed me that you were in such dire straits. As I played the song you came over to sit next to me and sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah did some Fall maintenance on our pets. After doing that they went for a ride. Hannah rode by herself and learned to steer BoBo in a circle. Watch &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, a very lucky Mr. Kee Kee narrowly escaped becoming a coyote dinner. The coyote jumped the fence chasing him into the neighbors yard. I chansed the coyote away once and then went and got shoes and a flash light. I was gone less than a minute when Mr. Coyote jumped back over. I threw a river rock at him and shooed him away over the hill that sits between us and hole twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very pissed Mr Kee Kee went to the vet to get checked out. The conclusion is that he was very lucky and Julie and I have decided to enlist Hannah&amp;#8217;s help in keeping Mr. Kee Kee inside &amp;#8211; permanently. Julie did mention that she saw a few unlucky mice (bones) in the x-ray they took of Mr. Kee Kee when he was getting checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish we got the pictures of our e-rays. From personal experience I wish I had a collection of all mine. Not only would it help me keep track of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

M-x replace-regexp&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; [[:nonascii:]] RET RET
It found and replaced the pesky tm symbols in the text file with nothing. I wonder if the [[:nonascii:]] char class is available on the command line in awk or sed?</description>

Since it was book club night Hannah and I had Mac n&amp;#8217; Cheese and then went to the pet store. She looked at all the fish but was more interested in the cats. She didn&amp;#8217;t want to choose I guided her into the Black Mollies and the Neon Tetras.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannah and I did some painting this afternoon. We did it out on the front porch because part of the process is making the paints, at least to start. The paint is some all natural stuff that is made from veggies and comes in powder form and gets mixed up with water. From past experience while painting with my daughter &amp;#8211; making up the paint is the least messy part of the session. But I told her that is why we were doing it outside, because it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if we are messy when we paint outside. We could just hose everything off after &amp;#8211; even her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah was a big help scooping the powder out and mixing in the water. OPnce we had the veggie paint set up we each did a few water colors and then she wanted black. Since we couldn&amp;#8217;t make black with the veggie paint Hannah finished up with the pre-mixed tube paints. When can I tell if her affinity with back is a goth tendency? Since I was not about to put paint all ovar myself to do handprints like she was I started trimming lilac shrubs. Then, when she was done I hosed Hannah, the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I understand that they do everything for the average customer and that really means the numbers that the MBA&amp;#8217;s and finance geeks tell them are important. There is no real person who is the average home depot customer and that means the individuals get passed over in the end.

      <title>Clean Up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was clean up day and investigate day. I started off with getting the murano&amp;#8217;s tires rotated and then brought it back home for closer inspection of the pads and rotors. They all looked ok. there was a hard to notice groove or ridge in the driver side rear rotor but hard to notice. I&amp;#8217;m not sure whats making the sound but I did notice that the front driver side shock seems to (slowly) be leaking something or something is leaking from above it. The bottom half of the boot was trashed so I removed it and it now matches the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did some watering and planted the grasses on the west side of the deck. They are supposed to grow 3-5 feet wide and 6-8 feet tall. We shall see how they do onec the roots veture out of the topsoil I placed them in. The only thing left to complete my summer project is to buy one large wall block and 2-4 toppers. Then I can rent a saw and make the cuts so that the toppers do not have gaps in them and the ends are flush and can be used as steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a hunter walking in&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just re-read what I put on the two pages bookending the &amp;#8220;Think Big&amp;#8221; two page spread in the in5 book. If I am not going to DO, why do I show up? To put it into a perspective that I have, lets talk riding. Riding anything, everything. I hope you like to ride as much as I do or at least have a passion for something that takes a mastery of your mind and your body in concert. For me thats where the soul lives. In the best rides, the lines that are the most fun are also the most challenging. Those are the sessions that force me to be &lt;em&gt;in the moment&lt;/em&gt; and I don&amp;#8217;t think. Once the trail is behind me I&amp;#8217;ll usually say to myself, &amp;#8220;Wow! That was fun.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it fun? That is the most important thing. Are the problems that you solve fun? If not, why do you wait for it to be fun &amp;#8211; make up a game for one. The volvo repair shop wants $850 to put in a new alternator and I can get it the same day. I would rather find something else to do with that money. So car repairs,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fall Planting</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-08-08-fall-planting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasses in back, next to the railing &amp;#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barberry plants &amp;#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &amp;#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&amp;#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch connector&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I built this. It is a split level addition to the deck. Complete with rose garden and paved path next to the house that leads to a sitting area (or golfers private driving range?) where you can watch your garden grow as golfers play through just like on tv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got done yesterday (The hottest day of the year) I sat, watched and I enjoyed a cool, refreshing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after I finished the heavy manual parts, we took Hannah to see a U2 cover band headline one of the Erie Concerts in the park series. I really enjoy them and like it better in the new park. Hannah was fascinated with the band, Once the Chik Fil A cow got out of the way she got her rock and roll dance on. It was fun &amp;#8211; I swung her around, showed her the hop and she carried the Irish flag around for a while. Although I think they do stuff with flag like shapes outside at school and her and Shaye seemed to want to shake the flag more than carry it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that this was the hottest day of the year? The car registered 101 when we got the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Double Edged Swords</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thats what I tell myself. Everything is a double edged sword. If I can&amp;#8217;t find the good I look for the useful. Thats why I find my self ambivalent to the ie ecosystem. That is where I have been hanging out for a few weeks and I have learned a few things about what I&amp;#8217;m used to and what I prefer. So, while its a crappy platform for the web, it&amp;#8217;s also over five years old. I&amp;#8217;ll bet if I tried to understand five year old firefox bugs it would be equally frustrating. What it comes down to is that Mozilla has done a better job of keeping their users up to date with the latest and greatest and while the web has moved on, ie7 has not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, shile running down table-layout: fixed oddness in ie7 I was struck by how much more useable chrome and firebugs tools are. They just feel slow in ie7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first discovered firebug. While really useful when compared to the web developer extension, it was rough around the edges and crashed on me a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whats the difference? Why are Chrome and Firebug so much better for me now? The web&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This morning while I was doing yard work Hannah did some work of her own. She went to the store (for real this time) and packed for camping. Now we are off to the store for some more sprinkler system parts and wood for the garden boxes.
Watching her at play is educational for me. I think my challenge as a parent is to disguise my advice (tips, tricks and my accumulated knowledge) in a way that she will accept it as her own idea.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-spirit-of-that-memory-hannah-says&#34;&gt;In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the story forward, I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;The dragon was full and she lay down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of reviewing my &amp;#8216;performace&amp;#8217; I hit the big items on my list here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/&#34; title=&#34;The Solo Week&#34;&gt;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/07/the-solo-week/&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t get to climb but everything else got the attention it needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes for the future. Staining is messy. I&amp;#8217;ll need to pressure wash the windows and deck furniture &amp;#8230; the wind blew it everywhere. The wood looks good though and i&amp;#8217;ll touch up on a cool day this fall. The Wall is built but I need one more big block and then three or four more toppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No pictures, I think I may switch to Google+ picture albums and just link to them here. A social network is not really the place for these kinds of posts but the picture manager I am using isn&amp;#8217;t as slick as the plus picture interface. Speaking of plus &amp;#8211; the coolest thing was supper easy. I got an email notification from the Erie, CO website for a police alert. It seems that 7 homes were bergled over the weekend and it was quick and easy to share that and target only the people who would be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, what I like, is a well thought out UI/UX. From looking at things that break&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Solo Week</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=4%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about someone who decides the day before what The Most Important Thing is for the next day. Then, as part of their routine they spend an uninterrupted 90 minutes working on that Thing. Sounds like a good idea. I am a create of habit and routine &amp;#8211; I like the balance it provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie and Hannah are heading up to McMinnville next week during Amgen&amp;#8217;s summer shutdown for a week off. I&amp;#8217;m not sure but I think I might be the one getting a week off 🙂 Shhhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to pseudo plan my solo week routine I have a list of the most Important Things that will need my attention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily walks or rides around with the dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ride -&amp;gt; WP&amp;#8217;s bike park is open and the new Valmont bike park needs to be scouted out for fun and to plan future trips with Hannah and perhaps Julie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb. It&amp;#8217;s much more fun than lifting weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build The Wall. I think the arc needs to go around to the fence post and then I can step down 3.5 or 4 steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Stain Pergola. Didn&amp;#8217;t get to last fall or spring &amp;#8230; &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug AMEX about the claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the Important Things are really just routines that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This past weekend, I read a blog post that talked about a data type for &amp;#8216;me.&amp;#8217; The argument premise is that blogs are nice and all but they don&amp;#8217;t capture everything. They only capture a pseudo linear timeline of my output. However the data in my output is more than just what I am thing or recording on a blog. It includes emails, social media things and stuff on my computers that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a happy home upon a cloud anywhere.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &amp;#8211; it has been a great Father&amp;#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &amp;#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later she asked me, &amp;#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her &amp;#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then my friends are cool.&amp;#8221; She said.&lt;/p&gt;

Hannah is not quite reading the Dr. Seuss book, &amp;#8220;Hop On Pop.&amp;#8221; Despite the drama that seems to have become part of the night night routine, I really like reading books with her. She has me point to the words and read them and then she copies me. She gets impatient when there are more than one sentence and uses the pictures as context and reads ahead.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can I create an interface if everyone is different &amp;#8211; does things in different ways, prefers their favorite flavors which are different from mine &amp;#8230; has a different emotional reaction than I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously this seems to have been handled with convention and the law of mass average, The law of mass average is my understanding that if you put a jar full of jellybeans out and ask people to guess the number almost everyone will be wrong. If you average the guesses from everyone you will be very close to the correct answer. This is what convention is. Everyone gets together when they use the same service and interacts with it differently. They buy the same product and react to it on different levels and then give feedback to the provider. It&amp;#8217;s minimal, but even no feedback is feedback for the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m starting The Dark Tower again. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how many times, but I&amp;#8217;ve read the first four books more then ten times now, a bit less for the last three though. I first line is epic in scale: (&amp;#8220;The man in black fled west and the gunslinger followed&amp;#8221;). -Note I need to verify the accuracy of my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pura Vida</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-05-18-pura-vida/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first Internet access in almost a week. Pura Vida seems to be local slang for &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s all good&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no worries.&amp;#8221; For sure that can describe the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monteverde was lush &amp;#8211; the biodiversity is amazing. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to re-read EO Wilsons book &amp;#8220;The Diversity of Life&amp;#8221; again because it was about places like this. We spent a day in the national park and our guide was very knowledgable of the flora and fauna. She especially liked birds. Besides the forest I saw signs of mountain biking in the area and would be very excited to come back and ride here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a too short stay in our almost private resort we drove down the coast to Manuel Antonio and went diving yesterday. Despite the murky visibility we saw a lot ot wildlife. Today the plan is to hike the national park here and end up at the beach. Hannah has gotten a lot of pool time but only a little beach time so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten some really good pictures but I can&amp;#8217;t post them yet. I&amp;#8217;m using Julies iPad to post this and besides the annoying typing corrections, it lacks the ability to post&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah was decorating a card for Mama Rosa and we told her to sign it. I told her the letters and she wrote them. It ended up on two lines because the blue and the brown decorations were in the way 🙂Hannah&amp;rsquo;s Signiture
In other news, Colorado&amp;#8217;s weather remains predictably unpredictable. Yesterday we had warm temps in the 80&amp;#8217;s and mostly clear and sunny sky&amp;#8217;s. Today it is raining with temps in the mid thirties, cloudy and I saw snow flakes in the air and on cars this morning.</description>

I know that what doesn&amp;#8217;t kill you only makes you stronger. Really though, how strong do I need to be?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to myself. Using the bluehost site backup tools did not go as expected. One minute there were 300+ public posts the next day there were 72. Weird I thought. I am happy that I did a manual dump last month. Here are the steps I took to restore my content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the remaning blog posts with the export function from my wp-admin export page. Lucky for me the sites small and I can just export everything and still get a reasonably sized file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From my laptop:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scp last-months-database-backup.sql to my bluehost account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into bluehost command line and run the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mysqldump -u -p dbname wp_users &amp;gt; wp-users.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the command line mysql client: mysql -u -p dbname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: use dbname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: source last-months-database-backup.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: source wp-users.sql (I think there was a confilct when I did step #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the website admin import area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the wprdpress admin import function select the file created in step #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be happy I can do this for myself 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its Time to write my own script that I can run from my laptop. Here is what I&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting Up My Dreams</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your imagination is the preview to life&amp;#8217;s coming attractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never written down my goals and usually [day]dream ideas and things I want to do when I am driving. Thats likely why I am only an average driver and make myself ignore the phone &amp;#8211; there is only so much processing power my brain can do at one time. There are several variations to the same themes in my daydreams &amp;#8211; snowboarding every day, solving interesting and profitable problems, migrating around the world with Julie to see and do fun things and showing Hannah the things I like to do and have found to be useful to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book they say when you write your dreams down they become goals. It isn&amp;#8217;t just writing them down though the most successful people review them on an ongoing basis. Perhaps the problem to be solved is two fold; first, my brain needs something concrete to focus on and second, in order to make progress towards my dreams (which are hazy and and ill defined patterns in my stream of thought) the dream needs to be refined as I understand it better, as I know myself better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my recent&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Early Photoshop</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-04-25-early-photoshop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m running out of things to distract Hannah with. She seems to be feeling better but it&amp;#8217;s only been 3.5 hours since she last spiked a temp of ~103. In an effort to create something for her to do and give myself some more time to play with css for today I resorted to the computer. I have heard enought dora and diego the past three days so I need to be creative in how I present things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/04/early-photoshop/images/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-1905&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1905&#34; title=&#34;PBS Logo&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/images1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;226&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-far-today-8230&#34;&gt;So far today &amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She watched the entire pbs kids am lineup, did playdoh and stamps coloring by herself. She got all the basket toys out and got into an argument with Kee the cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get a few more minutes and avoid anything Dora or Diego, I showed her how to use the track pad and made her click through all my links. More css rules are needed. I also want to take some more of the rules out of JavaScript and put it into the stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that failed to keep her interested (&amp;#8220;Papa I want to play games on your computer,&amp;#8221; she says to me 🙂 )Enter the old office computer and photoshop. Hannah can use the &amp;#8216;computer pen&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next part asks me to think about and determine my mission statement. Because of how I read I shortened it to mission and substitute focus in several places where that made more sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few inspirational quotes from famous and successful people and the book offers a few suggestions fo refining your own mission. For me that means I need to keep it short and concise &amp;#8211; focused. But I started out pretty verbose, rambling almost as a wrote a few paragraphs about all of my grandiose ideas over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote, my mind wandered and focused on the people who are most important to me. This automatically associated my grand ideas with them and I ended up with lots of details. I deleted the details but retained the association of important people in my life with important things to do with and for them. As I re-worked the text it expanded and contracted and gave clues to the direction I want to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is my mission? I like to be creative. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if I am finding a fun line down the slope or trying to find an easier way to get&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I walked far today. Well, not really far but farther than I usually do. I usually prefer to ride things. Standing is easy, walking is not hard but its harder than standing.
We took the dogs to a creek and Hannah rode in the stroller. I hope she feels better soon.
For my afternoon walk I stayed close in the neighborhood and walked around there for a few hours on a home improvement project.</description>

      <description>I was able to figure out how to hook emacs up to an ipad at work today. It&amp;#8217;s still pretty simple stuff, load the webpage I am working on and pop alerts. But still, if I can figure out how to debug the errors and get the command to send JavaScript to the device working &amp;#8230; this could be a huge timesaver for debugging mobile applications.
I&amp;#8217;m tagging this as a milestone only because it involves emacs, node.</description>

My turns are funny &amp;#8211; the radius gets biger the faster I go.
It&amp;#8217;s only saturday and I also finished the other mini project I started last night!!! I am very excited to hook up emacs, swank-js and node.js. Still not sure what I am doing but it is pretty cool to be able to proxy a site and develop it in a repl environment.</description>

      <description>Netflix is great. I want them to handle all my media needs.
I tried to watch an episode of Merlin the other day and it didn&amp;#8217;t work. The internets said that Netflix was having issues. Then, a few days later they contact me, acknowledge the issues with an apology and try to make it right.
That transparency makes me happy.</description>

      <description>I am very impressed with the start-up time and I think it&amp;#8217;s because of the ssd. These things rip fast. When I was young I read about computers and robots. In the books, they, for the most part &amp;#8211; runaway sub processes like Hal and friends, did what they were told .Fast! Now, I say go to sleep and its asleep before I finish closing the lid if I do it gently.</description>

      <description>I count seconds with the unofficial &amp;#8216;one thousand&amp;#8217; standard for timing things. When I say one thousand for a single digit number its roughly equal to a second. I say one thousand a bit faster for anything higher than ten because there are more syllables. The term roughly accurate comes to mind but isn&amp;#8217;t quite right.
Either way the fact that I only counted to fifteen and my new mbp went from off to login screen means that it starts up pretty fast.</description>

      <title>Identify Your Value</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The book starts off with a great line:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DECIDE WHATS NEXT IN YOUR LIFE AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO GET IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if strategize is a word but the idea is both powerful and subtle. We always tell each other our greatest wants, if only. Most of my if only&amp;#8217;s don&amp;#8217;t require huge amounts of money. More than money they require time and flexibility. Ask a meterologist to predict the next snow storm he can&amp;#8217;t do it, not with high accuracy. He can run the models, know the climate and the different types of weather patterns; but they are wrong more often that they are right because weather is random, truly unpredictable. The storms never hit exactly when they are supposed to, they never have as much or as little as they are supposed to. As in Life. So if i can&amp;#8217;t predict whats next and life is random, how do I get my &amp;#8216;If only&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s convenient for me?&amp;#8217;

      <description>Hannah was hopping down the stairs this morning every other step.
She was very coordinated until she tried to jump from the bend in the stairs to the floor 🙂</description>

      <title>Sad But Unsurprising</title>

      <description>The following JavaScript doesn&amp;#8217;t work in IE:
 var list = [&amp;#8216;.item1&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;.item2&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;.item3&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;&amp;#8230;
list.forEach(
function (item) {
$(item).hide();
});
 Sad. I wonder if the array object could be extended r prototyped to add that if IE is detected?</description>

      <title>Five Year Goal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am adding a new tag so that I can organize the things I have written down in the book Julie got me for Christmas.The name of the book is &amp;#8220;Five&amp;#8221; by Dan Zadra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through it once to understand it and then again to record my details. Now it&amp;#8217;s time to publish them so I can track my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book itself is a very nicely designed concept book. Through a thoughtful layout and color scheme it presents the tools that anyone has at their disposal to answering the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Where will you be five years from today?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question and answer format is interesting; it forces the reader to focus inward for the answers. And as fond as I am of snowboarding the Vasquez Cirque by myself or gentle morning yoga sessions that focus more on the mind than the body; I do very little inward directed thought to answer questions. Most of questions can be answered with a quick web search. However, for questions like this, there is no way to Google an easy or quick answer. As I went through the exercises the first time one thing became apparent. I have become very dependent on internet search to answer my&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Because It&amp;#8217;s There</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a post by someone who used to work at youtube a while back. He was talking about how most of the people he interviewed could not work on the DOM with-out jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like jQuery, it makes my job much, much easier even in the bastardized form I have to use it in. But, I liked the challenge and decided to work on the DOM with out a library, only using pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a few weeks of 2 hour nightly sessions to prototype, but I have something that runs. You can see the repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/hippeelee/ticker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I added a page called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/ticker.html&#34;&gt;ticker&lt;/a&gt;. Its a bare bones demo and still more concept than practical utility, but I am having fun fleshing it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are more elegant tools and plug-ins that do the same thing. It feels good to do it for myself, just because I can. A bit like cultivating a home garden. Sure, I am not on the scale as the professionals and sure, my solution is not ideal. But that wasn&amp;#8217;t the point &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOM with images was there and now I can make them do what I want. I learned a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A storm brewing to the west.
Take the scenic route.  It was one of those days, there was traffic on Dillon, more than I expected. It was a good thing; I got to spend more than ten minutes watching the world change as the weather front moved in over the front range.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, my dad would do things around the house, maintain our cars and fix things that could be fixed. As I grew I was often involved in helping him. At first I think I just got in the way, then I was an extra set of hands and later, I was fixing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a conversation we had about his tools where I was really focused on the why Craftsman Tools. Keep in mind this was back in the eighties and I was about 8; I am not sure who the main competitors were to Craftsman but I don&amp;#8217;t recall any brands of tools from back then other than Craftsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know why he used that brand. When we went to Sears, they were way more expensive than anything else I saw. His reply was that they were better and they backed it up. There was a guarantee that I understood as follows: The tools will perform and they will not break or we will replace it. How could they do this, I wondered? He explained to me that they believed in their tools so much that they were willing to replace tools that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am amazed at how long I went with out installing js2-mode on the netbook. To make it easy, I used the emacs default kit for saner defaults. Seems to work nicely.
I haven&amp;#8217;t been back to the orc battle since Christmas. I have been coding with the ruby koans and a fun little js project I am calling ticker. The idea is to use only pure js to make elements on a page tick, like a digital clock ticks its nuimbers away.</description>

In the one picture I am getting ready to eat lunch on top of the world. The other is black snow left over after they did avalanche control. It was surprisingly fresh and bouncy after I dropped onto it.

      <description>Hannah is running a fever again. On the one hand I know her immune system is getting stronger and more prepared to fight the future. On the other hand I was looking forward to taking her skiing tomorrow While everyone else snowboards.
I hope a good night of child sleep is just the thing she needs to bounce back.
Here are some pictures of me her last weekend. We found a hill close to home and went sledding, made snow sculpture and snow angels.</description>

Maybe that matters and maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t. If you run in to me down the road before you remember anything else about me, i&amp;#8217;ll bet you remember me as the guy who didn&amp;#8217;t call you back when I said I would.</description>

      <description>As I work through the additions I realized what bothers me about the cms. It gets in the way of my flow. I can&amp;#8217;t just do a bunch of things and then save them. I have to do one thing, wait for the blocking ajax call. I thought the point of ajax was to let the user do other stuff while the service worked in the background.
The system should be able to track where the user was and be able to quickly, )one click) get them back there.</description>

Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

      <title>Early Season Loop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before the storms roll through and they open up the back part of Vasquez Cirque, there is a loop that will provide all the powder and trees that I want. And it is only an hour and a half from my front door. Once you get there you can relax and enjoy the ride, the loop automatically repeats until only the base case is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be comfortable on packed or powder. Moguls will be fun for you and you connect more turns than you miss. Trees are good, less people go there and the snow stays soft and the sound is muted. You are comfortable with the Cirque and the high speed (50-60 mph) run out down to the tree line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Pano Express and start down the catwalk. Take your time, everyone is going fast so they can make the traverse. We will not be going that far. Keep your eyes peeled riders left and take the turn off to Bella Fourche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are listening to something good, turn in up and head down the path. After you pass the snow fences, look for your line between the trees. Keep your eyes peeled, there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on leading a meeting</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-01-14-thoughts-on-leading-a-meeting/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2011 17:08:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-01-14-thoughts-on-leading-a-meeting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been attending many meetings the past year. These are my unofficial guidelines to remember, hopefully they will help you host an effective and productive meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a compelling presentation. While I am not an expert on creating great presentations here are things I would recommend: Be direct with what you want to say, three word phrases or less. Your audience can scan the slide and then focus on you and what you are saying. The same goes for graphics &amp;#8211; make them simple to understand by pretending that you are creating it for the audience reading Time or Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start into the presentation let the audience know that you are going to talk through the slides first and that you will open up/ lead discussion after you are finished talking. This will allow you to present the information you do have in bulk and then, during the discussion you can focus on the feedback your audience is giving back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During your presentation focus on a simple, clear message and use as few words as possible to convey meaningful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan. Depending on the audience, plan your presentation accordingly. If the meeting is an hour long try to condense&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Here is my vision for the css3zen design. The theme is simple child shapes, blocks, circles, triangles and rectangles &amp;#8211; The first shapes that Hannah recognized. Since there is a child element we will keep the colors to primary (but you can use transparency if needed).
The layout will be simple, blocky and make use of whitespace. The imagry will incorporate the shapes theme and I&amp;#8217;ll use gimp to create them.</description>

      <description>It was most certainly out of the ordinary. And she wanted to go faster while yelling at me to let her do it on her own 🙂
It was almost as much work as riding the park and the pipe or carving out heelside turns that compliment the toeside. It was more fun than I have ever had on the slopes and I returned home a very proud papa.
At least equal to being hip deep in powder on a double black diamond above the treeline and more fulfilling than turning my first frontside 360.</description>

      <description>When I ran my site with WordPress there were a few things that bugged me but I didn&amp;#8217;t get to far beyond theming for it to really matter. It was easy to install, easy to configure and easy to use. And, it just worked. While I didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy all of the upgrading things I had to do, that was partly because I chose to run it on a personal server. Now that I am on their platform most of that pain has gone away.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading the &amp;#8220;choose your own adventure&amp;#8221; Books as a child and they were great fun. I didn&amp;#8217;t discover computers until college and missed out on the text adventure genre. The lisp exercises that Dr. Barski is taking me through are great fun. I really like the graphviz tool he created to vizualize the game nodes. I will be able to use that in some other areas that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finding that a scientific approach works well with his style of teaching. When I was in school for biology I did my best lab work when properly prepared. This entailed reading through the experiment/lab first and making sure I was familiar with all of the terms. Then, the experiment/lab was more fun to complete because I knew what to expect and the unanticipated things that came up were not roadblocks. I have been approaching the Land of Lisp book in a similar way: read the chapter first, try to understand the code he has written and look up new terms that I am not familiar with and then writing the code to get it running on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to getting GTW (Grand Theft Wumpus) working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I really like the Pingu animations. I like to watch them with Hannah because she really gets why it&amp;#8217;s funny. I have never seen someone focus so intently as she does.</description>

She was a little funny at the Halloween party. I am not sure if it is because she fell off Bobo (Totally her parental units fault), the lack of a nap or something else. At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&amp;#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her.</description>

I don&amp;#8217;t remember exactly what it was but I recall setting up a loop and calculating something for a long list of numbers, data collected in the lab. It was fun and got me my answer quickly and I did not have to muddle through the confusing Excel interface to find the function that would do what I wanted.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today she is three. I took the day off and we went down to the Denver Children&amp;#8217;s Museum. We got there when it opened and I think we got to all of the activities, some of them twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the fire truck, of course. And then we did a bit of shopping at the grocers after we did some construction. There were crayon rubbings and tree house tunnels and we used the words and shapes magnets for a while. Even I made some fun sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had snacks and then surveyed the outside playground. Hannah could do three of the monkey bars by herself! Then we went back inside and did some more construction and attended to some animals in the vet clinic and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got home a little after one and she slept for an hour and a half. Then when she woke up she had a melt down because her peanut butter and nubutella sandwitch wasn&amp;#8217;t evenly distributed when she peeled the slices of bread apart. both the pb and nubutella ended up on one piece. I cannot describe how traumatic this i for a three year old. It must be experienced. After assesing the situation I recommended that she&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I finally forced myself to figure out how to use the &amp;#8220;dired-do-query-replace-regexp&amp;#8221; command (Q) with marked files in the dired buffer. Turns out it is pretty simple and very handy for inserting google analytics tracking code into website files all at once.
Last night, after a silly and frustrating week I was so glad to sit outside with my wife and compare war stories.
Today, it&amp;#8217;s my not so new friend emacs that was there to lend a hand.</description>

      <description>Hannah told me that she pretends to be a little pink monster. She has added &amp;#8216;Scared of Monsters&amp;#8217; to the bed time stalling routine of read books, drink water, go potty, get Whitney &amp;amp; Gurgi, play songs on the guitar and talking.
Tonight we talked about playing in the pool and she was specific about differntiating girls stuff: bandaids, hello kitty and Mommy&amp;#8217;s activities from &amp;#8216;boy stuff&amp;#8217;.
One of the greatest pleasures of bing a parent is the short time between &amp;#8220;The Day&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Asleep.</description>

      <description>Wrode our bikrs to Bobo and put Hannah in the bike trailer. After we rode him up by the dump we sat.in the field and let him munch. Hannah and Julie were sitting down while Hannah tried to put her new pink helmet on julie.
She came to the conclusion: I think it&amp;#8217;s to big.
Oh girl, you are thinking now. 🙂</description>

      <description>Busy is the word of the day.
Up at six to see the balloons. A great spring morning. After brunch I pushed the mower around the yard. I think Julie is right about the backyard. I will be interested in what they propose.
We met Erica and Jeff in Denver for the rocky&amp;#8217;s game. Hannah was pretty tolerant of all the running around. We got home early and Julie was not feeling well.</description>

      <description>if Mt St. Helens ever went cold enough for snow to collect it looks like a great back country bowl to ride.
I am watching NOVA and it infotms me that it erupted in 2007 but it was nore of a fizzle. then the seismic activity went quit. Cool.
it was warm today. Sunny with strong winds out of the north.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

      <description>i started at the parking lot of my new job. behind the parking lot, there was a trail. i wanted to see where it came out. it exits on 119th and that means i can easily ride to work.
it was partly sunny and cool, around 60 degrees, but windy; so i rode up the the coal creek trail and took that until it ended up behind a golf course. along the way there was quite a bit of mud.</description>

      <description>After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.
i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.
I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods.</description>

      <description>Hannah is rapidly developin her language skills. if you can say it she will repeat it. she really likes sining her songs and demands that we listen to Hannah&amp;#8217;s music when driving in the car.
she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse.</description>

      <description>Anticipating the Avatar movie. i hope it lives up to the marketing.
Hannah is making cookies with MamaRosa and PapaRosa at the Macks and Santa is on his way. its her second xmas and i think she kinda gets it. Tommorow should be fun.
[[Update]]
Good story, awesome effects. The 3d was really cool but not the whole movie. Enjoyed the story and got some ideas for my own. If I can&amp;#8217;t find a decent employer this year, maybe I can write a decent story of my own.</description>

Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&amp;#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&amp;#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said,</description>

      <description>Todo: put the big girl bed together for Hannah.
It seems we can only use the conversion kit or the safety rail. They are not compatible together. I wonder how many times she will fall out before we take the conversion kit off amd use the safety rail.</description>

      <description>I tricked Hannah into going to her room friday night. She started out in my bed with mama and then i took her into her crib when i went to bed. It helped to hold her on my shoulder until she was uncomfortable and wanted to go to sleep. Then i asked her if she wanted to lie down in her crib. She said yes and was snuggling down, back to sleep in a few minutes.</description>

      <description>Since setting up at the new shop I have seen several issues with the legacy codebase that I am working with.
The biggest thing that throws emacs off is the inconsistency&amp;#8217;s that tabs cause in various parts of the code. some places have no tabs others are all tabs for indentation. Since I don&amp;#8217;t really care one way or the other I finally googled &amp;#8216;emacs + tabs&amp;#8216; and learned about tabify/untabify.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1217&#34; title=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; alt=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427-300x199.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bella Hunting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>We stopped at the outlets on our way home from the lilac circle Breckenridge weekend. Hannah was sound asleep when we got out of the car. I carried her into the first store and she heard the music, opened her eyes and started bobbing her head to the music for a minute. Then she closed her eyes and snuggled back down into my shoulder, fast asleep.</description>

      <description>Great end to my day.
I ran throughy the nite time books with Hannah. Her two favorites are the Elmo alphabet book and the color and shapes farm animals book.
Then we said our nite nites. Nite nite list: mama, papa, Gurgi, Whitney, Bella, Bo Bo, mama Rosa, papa Rosa, grandma Cheryle, grandpa Paul, tease, Sierra &amp;#8230;.
Then, after I put her in her crib I did the signs for &amp;#8216;papa love Hannah.</description>

      <description>Had a gentle second ride on my mountain bike this season. They did a good job with the improvements. I haven&amp;#8217;t ridden the loop part up top so that was fun, and a bit rocky. The meadows were still very green. It&amp;#8217;s almost like being back in Ohio.</description>

      <title>Easy Scanner Fix</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-06-10-easy-scanner-fix/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember, if you are just getting started with a mac, or any operating system, right click everything. Chances are you will get a contect menu with relevent operations for the object that you right clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I went over with Dad last Sunday (Yuuguu is the most helpful screen sharing app):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command + a =Ã‚Â select all. This applies to files in the finder when you are viewing a folder, the desktop, pictures in iPhoto and even the text in a writtne document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you hardware (scanner / printer) has an issue try unplugging it and then plugging it back in before you look at anything else. Worst case scenario, use the System Preferences/Print &amp;amp; Fax pane and uninstall/reinstall your printer software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad&amp;#8217;s intro to spotlight. After we &amp;#8216;fixed&amp;#8217; the scanner he tested it to make sure it worked but he didn&amp;#8217;t choose the right folder to save the scanned image in. Since he roughly remembered the name he used I directed him to the little magnifying glass in the top right hand corner of his screen. Dad, meet Spotlight. He typed in the name he remembered and there it was in the drop down list. I told him to click&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>I miss riding my mountain bike to work. I am not talking about the crappy bike lane commute into boulder. I miss the ride from the Moorepark trailhead to Amgen in Thousand Oaks.
It took about 45 min, had showers when I got there and I usually had the trail to lonesome.
Time is a luxury that I didn&amp;#8217;t realize I had until I started to run out of it.</description>

      <description>Internet radio is so very convienient. Not having cable I can&amp;#8217;t watch the Cavs stay alive on TV. Since they don&amp;#8217;t offer me the opportunity to pay to watch on NBA.com, at least not that was easy to find, I fired up iTunes and there it is under the sports/talk internet radio section.
It reminds me of visiting my Grandpa I when I was little. He used to sit under he awning and listen to Indians games on a little portable am/fm radio while playing solitaire in the afternoon.</description>

This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining.</description>

      <description>From the book JavaScript: The Good Parts is this little gem.
The lineage of an object is irrelevant. What matters about an object is what it can do, not what it is decended from.
&amp;#8230;
Prototypal Inheritance:
You start by making a useful object. You can then make many more objects that are like that one.</description>

Context: She was eating mac and cheese ( my favorite meal for as far back as I can remember ) and saw me put the pudding cups into the fridge.
She pushed her plate of mac and cheese away and pointed the pudding and said, &amp;#8216;I done. Want that.&amp;#8217;</description>

      <description>Vacation week is underway and Hannah is running a fever. This afternoon, she got all snuggly, and then her temp spiked to 104 for a few minutes. 10 long minutes later it was 102 and ten after that it was 100. Forty five minutes later it was normal, mama was home and Hannah was turning around yellng in that todler half speak that she makes up.
I&amp;#8217;m sure traveling will be interesting.</description>

She did great! Going to school is hard, I forgot how much so from the last time. I guess I did it to myself, I could have turned the scholarship down, but then I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have these interesting shell scripting word problems to solve. They make a pretty good puzzle. And this class only goes for a few more weeks.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts that need to be written down so I don&amp;#8217;t forget them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hannah knows what work is, sort of. This morning she woke up late, 7:30. (Such a great little sleeper) And Her first words to me were &amp;#8220;Mama?&amp;#8221; I am pretty sure she was asking where was Momma. So I said, &amp;#8220;Mama&amp;#8217;s not here kiddo, she is gone already.&amp;#8221; To which she replied, &amp;#8220;work.&amp;#8221; Later she did it again when Julie was on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strange Animal signs. When Julie was going through the letter flashcards she did this cute elephant trunk simulation with her arm. I took a video of it but haven&amp;#8217;t processed the raw footage yet. I&amp;#8217;ll try to get it posted before we leave for North Carolina on vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we were on a date night last night Hannah hung out with Shaye. Apparently they spent a few minutes pointing to each other and saying their names. Hannah points at Shaye and says, &amp;#8220;Saye.&amp;#8221; (I think she is still working on some of her phonetics). Then Shaye points at Hannah and says, &amp;#8220;Hannah&amp;#8221;. Form what I heard this repeated for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning. Hannah is a little&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>Hannah wanted to read the cat book this morning. We read it twice. Her favorite part was where the little kitten pops out of the rain boot and I say, &amp;#8220;meow, meow, meow!&amp;#8221;
Then we went through the alphabet cards. She is picking up more hand gestures from school, plus she is part Itallian and Italians talk with their hands. At least my family does, you should see the holiday gatherings!</description>

      <description>Interesting, you can remove everyhing between bracktes (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;). It works with html and I think it handle xml but didn&amp;#8217;t test that for my homework.
sed &amp;#8216;s/&amp;lt; [^&amp;gt;]*//g&amp;#8217;
It finds the first &amp;lt; character and then deletes all text up to and including the next &amp;gt; character. Interesting.
You could rehtml stuff but it might take several different scripts. There may be better ways to rehtml stuff.</description>

      <description>I just found out that SomaFM &amp;#8211; Groove Salad is available for the iPhone and over Edge. IT&amp;#8217;s getting addicting and I amy have to pony up some cash for them if I keep usingÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â bandwidth.
I also think that Groove Salad *sounds*different at night. I was doing homework after mid-night last night and the night before and there were some really cool remixes of songs I have heard before on there.</description>

      <description>I find mysefl running ps -ef | grep WORD (usually Safari but sometimes other things) alot. The Safari 4 beta is nice but still has some issues and it keeps locking up on me when I forget and use Conkerors navigation commands. Maybe I should just force myself to spend more time in Conkeror since its more emacs friendly. Not wanting to continue typing the same thing over and over again I wrote this:</description>

      <title>Practical awk/sed For My Job</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-04-20-practical-awksed-for-my-job/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-04-20-practical-awksed-for-my-job/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Client gave me a list of do not call numbers that has 10 digits on a line. We only have 3, 6 and 7 digits phone scrubs. Using the 7 digit scrub I should be able to use the file the client gave us as a seven digit scrub if I just remove the last three digits from each number in the clients do not call list. The clients list has 686,930 numbers in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual approach of recording an emacs macro just bogged down the computer and there is also this weird error when I use C-u with large numbers (i gave it the prefix of 100k) and it bombed out after 25k or so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I though about it for a minute and then played around with awk and sed until I came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;awk &amp;#8216; {print $1} &amp;#8216; UT_suppress.txt | sed &amp;#8216;s/[0-9][0-9][0-9]$//&amp;#8217; &amp;gt; UT_supress_7digit.txt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done in less than a minute and I now have a file with seven digits on each line that will not send any numbers on the clients do not call list. &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;Now I am just waiting for the utility script to load that file into the database and its not nearly as fast as awk&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>When I was a child my mother and grandmother made something called pizza frit. It was really simple but really good. Fried dough rolled in sugar.
When I was in high school I would camp out in the back woods on my parents property and mom would bring us a huge bowl of pizza frit.
I recall this because Julie took me out to Lucile&amp;#8217;s for breakfast and they had pizza frit (they used a different name and powdered sugar instead of granulated but it was the same).</description>

      <description>There really is an M-x do-anything functionality built into emacs. I am building a form for a client and for some reason the select code they supplied has year options starting at 1920 and ending at 2009. SInce I highly doubt that we get many people who will choose 1920 through the site and because I don&amp;#8217;t want to annoy users who choose the most recent years I figured I would reverse the order, if I caould find M-x functionality that would let me do it fast.</description>

      <description>I have been getting better at using the regexp search functions in emacs. Today I got tired of all this typing: M-x search-forward-regexp so I bound it to this in my init file:
 (global-set-key (kbd &amp;#8220;C-c sfr&amp;#8221;) &amp;#8216;search-forward-regexp)
 Of couse I also bound the opposite:
 (global-set-key (kbd &amp;#8220;C-c sbr&amp;#8221;) &amp;#8216;search-backward-regexp)
 I know, I know, how did I get anything done when I had to type out all thise characters before.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Bella has been missing the last few days. Julie last saw her by Black Rock Elementary on Thursday. We have been letting her out during the day because she gets really crazy when she is confined to the house &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. We though she was gone because we didn&amp;#8217;t have a tag with our numbers on there but I just confirmed that she is at the BVHS (Boulder Valley Humane Society).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dilemma is if we should keep letting her out or not. I am aware of the risks but I wonder if it is crueler to keep her inside all of the time (and crazy) or let her out where she can take her chances and happily goes about her business. I know I would always opt for taking my chances but I am not a cat. Since she is a cat and she can&amp;#8217;t really tell me what she wants, other that to observe her behavior; her behavior tells me that she likes to go outside. I think we will try to find a happy medium: she can still go outside, but only when we are there in the yard. We will also be getting her a tag for her collar&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You have been fighting an infection since late last week. On Sunday you hardly wanted to play. Just cuddle with momma and take naps all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before last you woke up at midnight. You settled into the chair next to my side and we read one of your books. The encyclopedia one. Then I read to you from a book I was reading, Heart in Atlantis by Steven King. I have read it before but I like the story. In about a half an hour you were sound asleep and I tucked you in and kissed you goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight when I moved you into you own bed you fussed a little bit so I rocked you like I did when you were little. You fell asleep on my shoulder and it was the best part of my day; next to eating yummy Julie cake fresh from the oven. Then when I thought you were asleep I moved you into the crib. You weren&amp;#8217;t asleep. I got you to lay down and gently rubber your back in comfort. It&amp;#8217;s been a while but I do remember what it&amp;#8217;s like to have a fever. After a few minutes you got quite again and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>load-file and grep</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-04-08-load-file/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;M-x load-file is my emacs lisp friend. I am playing around with fizzbuzz.el and got tired of C-x C-e after an expression of C-j inside one so I googled around and learned about load-file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;load-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `files.el&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(load-file file)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load the Lisp file named file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just what I wanted to do, run my code all at once. If I had more time I could even bind a custom keystroke in my init file and not have to type all of that text out. Now if I could only figure out why only half of the numbers are printed to the *Messages* buffer? If I run the command with C-x C-e it does the same thing the first time, but on subsequent tries it will put all of the output I am expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I figured out how to use grep from inside of emacs. I can&amp;#8217;t wait to have a change to try it out in my sandbox rather than on silly html forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still getting the php yy_blah () out of memory error. So if I restart the server and the issue goes away, what does that mean? php has a limit on the amout of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Pink Elephant pj&amp;#8217;s are for you Amy, since you liked the footie pajamas. I am not much of a fasionista, but, little girl clothes and shoes are pretty darn cute. So much so that I would even say its fun getting Hannah dressed in the morning. More fun than dressing myself since most days I could care less what I put on. When I dress Hannah, I actually think about stuff like matching and what she would like depending on the weather.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are birds chirping and I hear some muted &amp;#8220;whoo hoo&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; in the trees. There are 2-4 foot drifts in the trees and some thigh high drifts up on top of Vasquez Cirque. Yummy! The next run is Certainty and the ridge that gets the most snow, at least that&amp;#8217;s what I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly did. I opted out of dropping off the cornice that forms on the left side of the run for the grove of trees and really big rocks on the right. Up top the un-tracked powder was thigh high at least. When the slope is that steep the turns are so smooth and easy it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like turning on a snowboard. Once I got below the trees to where the rocks form a narrow gully, about ten feet wide I stopped to pick my line. Between the two largest rocks there is a nice channel that drops left, back into the Certainty slope and I had a very fast run out in the powder field below where I got some more beautiful turns. Then, below the next ridge, down underneath the tree line it was good, really good. Its a lot of work to get over there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah learned to rinse herself off tonight. All on her own she started filling up the rinse cup and pouring it over herself. She only swallowed a few mouthfuls.
Other things of note: She is starting to connect two words together, like &amp;#8220;Hannah milk&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;up please&amp;#8221;. Also, her repetition is getting stronger. When I was home with her on Tuesday we went through the books and flash cards several times.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice day, good weather. I got two nice drops into Vasquez Cirque. It was a little bumpy but there were still some calf/knee high patches and some decent turns leading into them. I need to think about dropping in less, unless I plan on going down one of the rocky chutes, I noticed that my turns feel more natural when I am reacting to the conditions of THIS turn rather than thinking about the next turn or the last turn or the really big rock that is coming up fast.Ã‚Â VisualizationÃ‚Â is still good at the top, it gives me a game plan but plans don&amp;#8217;t always turn out as you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got two runs down the baby park, popped some nice mellow airs on the baby five footers and the little rails and boxes are always fun. The biggest surprise was the carving and turns on my way back to winter park parking lot. I leaned into some gorgous s-turns and got really good extension both toe side and heel side. There was a bit of corn on the way down too, spring is fast approaching (the last week of weather aside). The last three weekends should be great for&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the late winter snowstorm threw a monkey wrench into my plans. Cheryle and Paul&amp;#8217;s flight was canceled so I get to swap snowboarding for Hannah duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far today we have had our morning coffee and milk, opened and closed the blinds over fifty times and played 52 card pickup with the flash cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What amazed me though is that Hannah decided it was elmo time and she didn&amp;#8217;t want to read the books. She went over the the tv (which i forgot to re -child lock) and opened the door to the DVD player where her elmo DVD&amp;#8217;s are, picked up Sesame Street &amp;#8211; Count With Me DVD and tried to put it into the player. All this just from watching me and Julie put dvds in to play. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll trade snowboarding for Hannah time anyday because riding is always there, but I can never have enough Hannah time. And she will only be little once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans for later today are to go to REI and exchange my hat, visit Julie in Longmont for lunch, look for a split board at the store Julie said is going out of business, naps and shoveling the driveway so it doesn&amp;#8217;t turn into a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to Costco tonight to pick up a few things. While I was waiting for the guy to check on the camera model I wanted, I entertained Hannah with the piano. I mostly played keys and a few cords. Hannah banged on a few keys too but she was mostly interested in the buttons and knobs.
Then we started naming things. There was a display of iPods and Hannah astutely pointed out the apple logo that was just at her height and about twice as big as her head.</description>

      <title>Matthews Fizzbuzz</title>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-03-24-matthews-fizzbuzz/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During lunch I came across a reference to the fizzbuzz question (ie for the integers between 1-100 &amp;#8230; print fizz if the number is divisble by 3, buzz if divisible by 5 and fizzbuzz if divisible by both) in reading someone&amp;#8217;s blog. I have always said to myself, I need to see how long it will take me to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javascript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;var fizzbuzz = function(){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;Matthews Fizzbuzz&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//an array to hold my numbers and numses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var nums = new Array();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for (x = 1; x &amp;lt; 101; ++x){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nums.push(x);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for (z=0; z &amp;lt; nums.length; ++z){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if(nums[z] % 3 == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; nums[z] % 5 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;fizzbuzz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}else if(nums[z] % 3 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;fizz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}else if(nums[z] % 5 == 0){&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;buzz&amp;#8221; + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;else{&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(nums[z] + &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var start = new Date();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;start = start.getTime(); Ã‚Â // returns millisecs since epoch which is what I want since this operation takes less than a second&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;start += parseInt( start );&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fizzbuzz();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var end = new Date();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;end = end.getTime();&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;end += parseInt( end );&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;document.writeln(&amp;#8220;This took &amp;#8221; + (end &amp;#8211; start) + &amp;#8221; milliseconds to run&amp;#8221;);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes: it took me about five minutes give or take and I have seen it report between 2-4 milliseconds to run. The current program is 33 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emacs Lisp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running With elisp</title>

      <description>I need to remember the other ways to run my elisp code. It will help to be able to do it inline when I want the resutls put into the documet I am editing, it will also help to be able to run a function from where my point currently is when I am figuring out somthing. To that end here are three ways to run elisp code:
 C-j: will spit the result into the *scratch* buffer when testing scratch code there M-C-x: will echo the result into the mini buffer when the point is in the function C-xC-e: will echo the result into the mini buffer when point is just after the last )  These commands also work for atoms: expressions not in parens such as numbers, strings, characters and symbols.</description>

      <description>Well Spring arrived in a big way this weekend with clear blue skys and temps in the mid 70&amp;#8217;s. Yesterday, e got the lawn ready by power raking it and top seeding. Hannah helped us by bonking her head three times and falling off the patio once, right on her face.
What else did we do, On Saturday we went to the REI grand opening at the Orchard Town Center Mall but did not stand in line for the free gift cards.</description>

      <description>That is the main point of this post. I think it also applies to other things besides coding, things I am more familiar with like snowboarding, mountain biking and other real world activities.
When snowboarding if you want to go fast Turn less and just go straight. Depending on your skill level you may want to waer a helmet and try this when no one is around. The same for mountian biking, just brake less but at strategic times.</description>

      <description>While we were playing this morning Hannah wanted to wear my sunglasses. I told her she looked like a little spy.
I think she is like her pappa in that she doesn&amp;#8217;t like changes. They upset her internal balance mechanisms. When mamma and pappa go to work, it&amp;#8217;s a big change in her enviornment so it has been really traumatic for her since Kat started to watch her instead of Marie.</description>

      <description>Hannah strongly did not want me to get her dressed or brush her teeth this morning. She had to do it herself.
She also wanted Mammas muffin but could not have it. When she started complaining mamma used a bit if sarcasm in her voice when she told Hannah how mean we are. Do todlers understand sarcasm? Or did she just know that we were talking about her?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dad called last night because his Time Machine was not backing up. So tonight we had another mac session. Here is what we went covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time Machine: To check the status of time machine you can open &amp;#8216;System Preferences&amp;#8217; and click on Time Machine in the &amp;#8216;System&amp;#8217; row, second row from the bottom. Or, if you have the circular arrow with either the clock or the ! in it in the top bar of the screen you can just click that. Then I showed him how to make sure his Time Machine hard drive was mounted on his file system and if not, how to connect to it. Pretty easy,, we started a back up going and moved onto other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad wanted the pictures from the Cool Hannah Pics web page the we keep with mobile me. He had figured out how to download them one at a time by going to each picture, clicking the download link and then, after it downloaded, in the downloads window he would click the magnifying glass to &amp;#8216;Open in Finder.&amp;#8217; Then from finder he could drag it into iPhoto. &amp;#8220;Very good!&amp;#8221; I was proud of him and congratulated him for his investigative efforts. Then I&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been spending more time in my sandbox at work lately and each time I need to go into the seperate parts of the system to update my sandbox form the repository trunk. Now that I have set up my ssh keys and no longer need to type in a pwd twenty times there was no reason to have to run svn update blah for the four parts of our system that I look at or use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter update_svn.sh and I can just ssh into the server,Ã‚Â cd to my sandbox and run update_svn.sh and voila I get this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ ./update_svn.sh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;updating blah&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>It must be getting close to spring. Riding conditions were not ideal this morning. The Cirque was crusty and icy in places. Not at all like after a fresh snowfall. I hikes it once and then did a few groomer runs but carving was hard; there were to many people to carry speed through the turns safely.
Last week I watched some of re Mammoth videos from after their monster storm last month.</description>

      <description>Oh cool! On my way home today I got an email telling me that I got one of the scholarships for the mainframe administration certification at DU. The test was hard, it touched on concepts that are hazy memories from school four years ago. I may have to go back and do a bit of review so I can touch up on those concepts.
From what i can read about the last class It looks like I&amp;#8217;ll be spending alot of time on the command line this spring.</description>

Changed the oil in the Murano. I&amp;#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.
Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago.</description>

I went around twice and my lungs felt better at the top. I am looking forward to riding the heil + hall trail in a few weeks when late spring hits.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Book&lt;/strong&gt;: Mom needs some labels printed out so we started by selecting some contacts in the address book to print and setting up some preset Avery labels by label number. The workflow is as follows: Select one or more contacts to print, then choose File &amp;gt; Print. In the print dialog that pops up choose Mailing Labels as the Style and the Layout option. Now you can specify the page (We chose Avery Standard because they are printing on normal 8.5 x 11 paper) and then the label id number: 8160. WHen he did a test print of 10 contacts on a scrap piece of paper he found out that the left margin was off so we set up a custom label that was almost like the preset. We made note of the Margins: Top, Left, Right and Bottom and the gutters (vertical and horizontal space between individual labels), the number of rows and columns. Since the preset had the incorrect left margin we chose &amp;#8220;Define Custom: as the page and put in the noted top, bottom, right and gutterÃ‚Â measurementsÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â preset.We setÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â columnsÃ‚Â at two and the rows at 5.

      <description>Rode up at Winterpark today with Jean-Francois. He rode to, no tellys for him today.
We started off in the fresh pow of Eagle Wind until they stopped blasting the Vasquez Circque. The mile+ hike is totally worth it. I haven&amp;#8217;t been on steeps like that since the Mammoth days and this was way less tracked because of the hiking required.
On the way home, he said we had to stop in Idaho Springs and get something called a &amp;#8216;mountain pie.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had Julie give me some feedback on the splash page/dashboard I have been working on. She gave good feedback that I was able to use to refine it a bit. I think she was a little afraid of hurting my feelings though but she shouldn&amp;#8217;t be, we are married after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only pushed out the layout changes and the changes to the latest post. I still need to figure out where the weather widget(s) will go and how they will behave (as tabs or as content areas that dynamically expand when the user is interested in them. I am not sure. I also need to spend some time updating the categories and making sure they are all posted in in the right category. Categories will also need to be changed a bit so that they are all capitalized. The other thing I was going to do with cats is to make several main categories like Outdoors (or Computers, Home, Cars, ) that all of the riding, hiking stuff can go under, then it will rise to the top of the top category&amp;#8217;s script when those links are generated. Maybe I write my ideas down and have my better&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Papa Mac Session: Right Click Everything</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-02-12-papa-mac-session-right-click-everything/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a brief synopsis of what we did tonight using yuuguu to share screens and learn about basic mac functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SELECTING ALL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command + a (command is the apple key with the squiggly shape on it next to the space bar) will select all the items in the application that has focus. So if you have e folder like &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos&amp;#8217; opens via the Finder it will select all of the photos in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT MENU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control + left mouse click will bring up a context menu. This is the same as a right click from the mouse. Wen you bring up a context menu the options in the context menu are dependent on the application that has focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMBINING ACTIONS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can combine both of these actions to do things. For example, last night you wanted to delete all the pictures in the &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos.&amp;#8217; I had you select them all with [command + a] and then send them all to trash by right clicking on a selected (highlighted in blue in your case) to bring up the context menu and choocing/clicking on send to trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIGHT CLICKING:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right clicking EVERYTHING is a good way see what actions you can do. You can learn alot about&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After I upgraded php and wordpress to 2.7 I started getting out of dynamic memory errors. Here is what I am seeing:
 Fatal error: out of dynamic memory in yy_create_buffer() in /path/to/my-blog/wp/wp-admin/post.php on line 12
 I upped my memory_limit to 256 to give it more to work with but that doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be enough. I&amp;#8217;ll have to dig around in php.ini and on wordpress.org to see if anyone else has run across this.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trouble shooting with dad; tonight&amp;#8217;s session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with iPhoto, we went over some basic things to get started. I showed him navigating in the iPhoto app itself. We went to one of the recent items and looked at the pictures there, the photo library and an album that already existed. Then, I had him make a new photo album, multi select several photos and add them to the new album. Then we renamed the newly created album. Next we made a slide show from the photo album. We selected all the pictures in the new album &amp;#8216;chris&amp;#8217; and modifed some of the slideshow settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we moved on to trouble shooting the scanning issue. First, we made sure all images in the scanned photos folder had been imported into iPhoto, then we deleted the old scans. The HP Scan software was having trouble connecting to his scanner so I deleted the printer and re-added it using the system preferences &amp;#8211;&amp;gt; print &amp;amp; fax. This re-installed the drivers for his printer. Next, we went through the scanning procedure that he is already familiar with: start HP Scan, preview image, choose saving options and scan the photo. We both scanned and saved a photo&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This picture is of me hiking up to get some turns. Given my limited back country experience it was the first time in a long time that my heart rate was already going even before I dropped in, and, I only hiked halfway up the slope pictured in this picture.</description>

      <description>By Sunday morning, WInterpark had over two feet of fresh powder. I spent the morning riding Parsens bowl until that got really tracked up and the lift line got long. Then I made my way down the catwalk to Eagle Wind and rode in the trees till it closed. I found some thigh high stashes but most of it was mid calf or knee high.</description>

      <description>Hannah has been on a crazy book kick lately. In the morning she brings me four or five books to read and point out things she knows. Mainly she knows the animals. In the evening, she will do the same. Once, when I was helping Julie get dinner ready she kept bringing the Encyclopedia book to both of us and got pissed when we told her she had to wait a few minutes.</description>

      <description>I stumbled on a link where that auther set up some custom abbreviations for emacs. This is just the thing to complement yasnippet mode. I set up about 11 custom abbreviations for editing forms with ARG&amp;#8217;s core custom data points. so now I can type the following and hit enter to get the desired form input:
 ae -amp email: &amp;lt;input maxlength=&#34;50&#34; name=&#34;q1&#34; type=&#34;text&#34; value=&#34;&amp;lt;V1&amp;gt;&#34; /&amp;gt;   afn -first name: &amp;lt;input maxlength=&#34;</description>

      <description>It was a pretty nice day here yesterday. The temp got up to about 60 degrees and thats unusual for this time of the year. I should have been able to leave the pups at home except for Whitney&amp;#8217;s ear. She had a wart like growth on it that needed to be removed so Julie and I performed some minor surgery. The only problem with it is that it was on her ear and head wounds tend to bleed, alot.</description>

      <description>Make a home-made Mocha:
1) brew some yummy costa rican coffee
2) in coffee cup add some coffee mate + two spoonfulls of cocoa
3) pour in an equal amount of hot coffee
4) stir until cocoa substrate is all in solution
5) fill cup with the rest of your coffee
6) enjoy!
In other news I came across some very useful code for dealing with dates in php:
strtotime() is a php function that takes a wide range of text inputs and returns a unix timestamp.</description>

      <description>Well the truck made it to Mary Jane but it&amp;#8217;s cold up here, about -4 at 9:30am. Hopefully she&amp;#8217;ll start for me when she cools back down 🙂
Thoughts I had on the way up:
Blender a spindrop logo. A raindrop clear bit colored with a hint of rainbow on it&amp;#8217;s surface and slightly twisted. Around the drop there is an orange halo spinning.
The truck made it home. Had a good 3 hour session.</description>

      <description>Hannah signed &amp;#8216;horse&amp;#8217; for me the other day. The only thing is she thinks all harses are called &amp;#8216;BoBo&amp;#8217;.
Other stuff: got the lights taken down and the truck running today. It&amp;#8217;s prolly not the fuel pump. Maybe the cold start sensor? I&amp;#8217;ll need to do some more googling to see what the internets say.
Other things to do: finish the script to grep out five images from the blog images.</description>

      <description>J, RK, and L saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tonight. It was a really good movie. Very effective and subtle cg and a good story line.
I find that post Hannah some movies affect me differently. The scene where BB sits and watches his daughter in the crib was really touching; I think because I have done that with Hannah. There is nothing more magical than watching your daughter sleeping and completely at peace.</description>

      <description>I was carrying you down to Masons house this morning and you almost jumped out of my arms. You really wanted to walk in the snow.
Then, when we got there Mason was already dancing to the radio and you joined right in. I didn&amp;#8217;t even have time to get your coat off.
On my way back I took a picture of your footprints in the snow.</description>

      <description>I just accidentally moved all images out of the blog folders and then deleted them when I thought they were test data. Crap. Why did I just do that? I guess I should have created real test data for my shell script to work on. 🙁
Update: yay for upgrades and backups. When upgrading to the latest wp software I realized that I had backups of the image folders and was able to replace them from my backup directory.</description>

      <description>My tiny girl is growing bigger by the day. She is getting to big to fall asleep
In my lap at bedtime. Lately she has been tossing and turning when we sit In the rocking chair looking at the moon and stars on the ceiling.
Tonight was the first time she wouldn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep for me. I had to put her in the crib so she could get comfy. Then her breathing slowed and her eyes closed and off she went to &amp;#8216;seep seep&amp;#8217; dreamtime land.</description>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-11-26-object-persistance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to put things out of Hannahs sight and she would turn her attention else where. Now she remembers the object and seeks it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight she was playing with the dog leashes and I put them up because she was tripping on them. Age went over to the counter top and tried to climb up to reach them. A bit later she was spilling milk all over the aerobed. I put the milk behind me off the bed and she promptly got off the bed and went over and got it from behind my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also doing these funny behaviors: cuddling &amp;#8211; she will come over and crawl into you lap if you are sitting or crawl on top of you if you are lying down. She signed cat last night when Bella joined us and wanted tonpet her. That was one of the first signs we started wit but I have not given it to her for a while. Other signs she knows include: more, drink, eat, mamma/pappa (I think she does the same for both) dog &amp;#8211; but very similar to cat it seems, up, blows kisses and she is starting to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While Julie and I were out Xmas shopping ok our date night we got ceramic room heater because you have been waking up with cold ears, nose and toes. I set it up tonight and it seems to keep your room much warmer.
I don&amp;#8217;t think that is why you don&amp;#8217;t want to sleep though.</description>

      <description>Observing my daughters play behavior, it looks to me like the energy of a toddler is intoxicating.
She just goes and goes with an intense focused concentration. Thats prolly why she learns so much so fast.</description>

      <description>Hannah is back with Marie and Mason today. After so much 1-on-1 time with me and Julie over the last few days I&amp;#8217;ll bet it was hard for her to see Momma drop her off this morning. I hope she gets back into her routine with Mason quickly.</description>

      <description>Hannah has been running a fever all day. 🙁
It started last night and has come and gone in waves all day. To try and make you comfortable we are alternating Tylenol and Motron on a regular interval. It&amp;#8217;s hard when your kiddo is sicko.
*update* Hannah is still got a fever; it&amp;#8217;s now going on three days. It fluctuates between 101 and 104. I am still giving her the Motrin/Tylenol treatments.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I traveled with Julie and Hannah to the Conejo Valley, she had training for work. Hannah and I hung out with Grandma Cheryle Today. I got a very good nap when Hannah took hers this afternoon, almost two hours. More of the same, I want to ride Sycamore but I have a couple of other things that I want to get done on the computer first so I may just go over there and get a quick trail run in. I have been running alot lately even though I profess to dislike it. I think that is because it is quick, out the door type exercise and convenient. I think I am going to take one of the rock climbing classes at the rec center this winter. Its been years since my harness has been used and I forget the knots and other stuff thats important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather here is really great. It was sunny and 85 today. It was overcast on Wednesday back in Erie but has cleared up even though fall weather has asserted itself in the last few days. Temperatures are only getting to the mid 50&amp;#8217;s or low 60&amp;#8217;s during the day and at night its getting below&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>**UPDATE** it turned out very well for Obama. Yay. Now he has to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. I really hope that he is better than either Bush or Clinton at working with others in the middle. The republicans lost alot of moderates so that will make things interesting for Obama and for the republican party itself. Could this be the start of a third party?</description>

      <description>**UPDATE2** boulderwindshields.com was great, they showed up early at my work location and had it filled in about ten minutes. you can still see where the chip was, barely. Hopefully it won&amp;#8217;t crack any further.
**UPDATE** boulderwindshields.com looks promising: $59.95 for the first chip. $30 better than the online quote J got. I filled out their contact form and am waiting to hear back from them.Ã‚Â
Julie found an online quote of $99 to repair a windshield chip in the Murano.</description>

      <title>Camera Fund</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-10-28-camera-fund/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-10-28-camera-fund/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The supposedly waterproof movie camera was not so waterproof. I am in the process of either getting it repaired or reimbursed for it under the credit card warranty. I submitted the initial paperwork and need to check online to see what the status of it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also starting a camera fund so I can get a new movie/dlsr camera. I already know which model I want, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. Since it will take really good pictures and movies its the best of both worlds. One think I found with the movie camera is that I take alot of one to three minute clips that get edited together. Not being a movie, my life doesn&amp;#8217;t require &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; filming to capture the memorable moments.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for having a camera fund is two fold:Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have $1500 cash lying around and I don&amp;#8217;t want to charge this purchase &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the time the fund has enough money for the purchase the price may have come down because of new models, competition or a decent used model might be on craigslist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to put a fund tracking widget on the splash page so I can track its progress with a graph/chart. Also, I could&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;p&gt;
    We had a blast in Maui for vacation.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I must say that is &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;really hard&lt;/span&gt;Ã‚Â slightly more difficult than usual to travel with Hannah. It was waaay different from the last time Julie and I went though. Then, we were on our honeymoon ad this time we were bringing Hannah bear.Ã‚Â Hannah only weighs ~20lbs but we brought what seemed like 120lbs of stuff for her. Babies require a lot of stuff.Ã‚Â
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Hannah started signing &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; for anything that she wanted, food, water, milk, and her momma. The second night there, it was my turn to take her when she woke up, she was on my bed and I was trying to get her to go back to sleep for an hour or so since it was only 3:30. She was having none of it. When she heard momma turn over on her bed she stood up, leaned on me and started frantically signing &amp;#8216;more.&amp;#8217; It was very cute. She also started saying &amp;#8220;uh oh&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; as in bah, and generally became very vocal with everyone when she was not extremely tired from lack of sleep. She is also trying to climb everything like mad.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

      <description>You have had some trouble adjusting to time zones. I doubt that you can even comprehend the distances involved in delineating the Maui time from the Denver time zone, yet.
That&amp;#8217;s ok, you have plenty of time to figure it out. Personally, I think it is harder to adjust when traveling west several zones and by the end of the week in Hawaii you were almost adjusted, then we flew you back.</description>

      <description>Riding new trails is always fun, at least the first time. Owen and I rode the new connector trail at Heil Ranch. Not extremely steep but a good fun trail. There are some rocky parts that can be a little technical. The speed up, slow down technical to keep your balance. There were some nice fast lines on the new connector trail to. And then coming down back to the Heil Ranch parking lot was fast and bumpy.</description>

I am looking forward to the android competition in the marketplace. And will strongly consider one of their offerings next, before buying a second iphone.
It is possible to remove the iTunes drm, so that&amp;#8217;s not a show stopper, the app store still seems buggy and has not impressed me much.</description>

      <description>Just recently, I learned how to use tramp mode for working on our servers downtown. It could quite possibly be the most useful mode I have discovered in emacs; as far as helping me be more productive at work. It lets me stay in emacs for more things both on my local box and on the servers downtown all at the same time. Yay!Ã‚Â
Now, If I could only figure out how to get code from the database by function id and then edit it in my local version of emacs and save the changes back to the db.</description>

Hannah got another head Bonk this morning. She was walking around the bedroom while I was washing my face and ran into a corner. Her favorite food seems to be bananas (coincidence?). She hasn&amp;#8217;t given me any new signs lately but I am still giving her more, eat, mamma, pappa, dog, kitty and horse. Julie has been working with her object identification: where is the kitty? Where&amp;#8217;s papa, etc for most of those signs.</description>

      <description>If we open up offshore drilling we will only increase our domestic oil production by less than 5% by the year 2030. I highly doubt that this will have any impact on gas prices now or then. But, I&amp;#8217;d bet money in vegas that the oil company that does drill there will damage and/or ruin the ecosystem. When have they not damaged or ruined an ecosystem they have had leases in?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Momma went to the movies last night. We got to hang out with the dogs and Bella. First I fed you dinner, a mixture of squash and something else orange. You had been snacking on cheese and were showing very little interest in eating so I let you use your own hands to feed yourself. While you were making a mess and feeding yourself I was able to get a few more spoonfuls in. I tried to get you to drink some of the whole milk we are starting you on but you were not a big fan of it.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was bath time. You really like bath time. I tried your momma&amp;#8217;s approach of putting you in the tub standing up while the water warmed up. Then we did some bubble bath soap and you were so interested in the bubbles that you stuck your face under the water. It was only a second before you stood straight up, gasping for air. I guess you wanted a closer look at the bubbles.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After bath time we took the dogs for a walk. Bella followed us to the mailboxes so we had to pick her up and take her back&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah is walking. She is catching her balance, looking for objects to walk to and use as a balance waypoint and still tripping and falling alot 😉
The weekend we got her some new shoes that will help her motor around. Since the weather is starting to turn we also got her some cool new hats.</description>

      <description>I was feeding Hannah breakfast this morning and she showed me the sign for more! She really enjoyed herÃ‚Â bananaÃ‚Â and oatmeal cereal with yogurt. Almost every time I asked her, &amp;#8220;More eat?&amp;#8221; she did the more sign. It was really cool to see my little girlÃ‚Â communicatingÃ‚Â with me on her own level and I look forward to many more interesting conversations with her. I am especially interested in her world view as she grows and her experiences take her into the wide, wide world.</description>

      <description>Labor Day is for doing labor, right? Anywho, I re-did the side to make it look less getto and to stop Mr. Gurgi from esacaping. Alas, when we did a test run by taking Hannah to the pool, one last time before summer ends, he escaped and was in the back yard! Julie thinks he jumped on the dog house and then jumped the fence and that&amp;#8217;s why he couldn&amp;#8217;t get back over.</description>

      <description>Julie told me this morning that Hannah signed &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; to Marie yesterday. When Marie feeds her lunch she says &amp;#8220;More&amp;#8221; but usually doesn&amp;#8217;t sign it. Hannah gave her the sign when she said it.
This morning when I was holding Hannah she gave me a big, sloppy open mouthed wet kiss instead of turning away and giggling like she usually does. That made my doy no matter what happens.</description>

      <description>I have the side yard (dog run) apart while I fill in the low areas of backfill around the foundation that has sunk. I am also putting a split rail fence, that T&amp;#8217;s off the fenceÃ‚Â separatingÃ‚Â our yard form the neighbors house, with a gate to seperate side yard from back yard. I&amp;#8217;ll also need to spread some some cover material that is not river rock. River rock is quite possibly the worst landscaping material I have ever seen or worked with.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night Julie and I decided that your first real word is &amp;#8220;Hi.&amp;#8221; You say hi to everything and its really funny. We were sitting outside on the patio having dinner and you said hi to both Gurgi and Whitney, Bella and a plane flying by in the sky. This morning on the walk to The Heathers, you said hi to the clouds, a few houses, the guy walking his dog, Bella who was following us and Mason and Marie when we got inside the house.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to remember to bring the video camera to your room when I put you to sleep so I can have it there when you wake up in the morning. Thats when you are most talkative. You are getting better at walking. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet but Marie says you can take 6 steps on your own without any assistance. I betcha that by the time we get to Maui in October you will be mostly walking on your own.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your other recent behavior is to point (and say &amp;#8220;Hi&amp;#8221;). You really like it when I point back at you and touch you ET style. You still like to High-Five but pointing is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hannah is hard at work trying to learn to walk. She really doesn&amp;#8217;t like to crawl much, I don&amp;#8217;t think it is fast enough for her. Every day she gets more adventurous with her walking attempts. I see her just standing there practicing her balance alot; her stance reminds me of a snowboarder or skater stance when you are riding at speed. Besides practicing her balance by standing there, sometimes she coordinates everything together and can take 4-5 steps no problem. Other times the coordination things messes up her plans and she loses her balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend we went up near Lyons to visit a co-worker of Julie&amp;#8217;s who has a son, Logan, very close to Hannah&amp;#8217;s age. They were playing together and crawling around all over the place. When we went out to their deck Hannah tried to walk through the door but got tripped up coming through the doorway. She fell forward and bonked her face 🙁 A few minutes later all was better cause she was in Mommas arms and we noticed that she had a tiny bit of blood inside one of her nostrils. Her first bloody nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had anouther pretty active weekend. Saturday after getting breakfast at&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah, you crack me up. There are little bruises that ate migrating around your forehead. I can see how it hurts you when you Bonk your heavy little head. But sometimes, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s really funny and your momma and I can&amp;#8217;t help buy laugh.
Like tonight when we were lying on the floor playing, crawling and reading books and you were so happy. You werr just sitting there babbling and jumping on us and then I gave you the moracca.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I rode the 25 mile loop near Gold Hill Trailhead. Still can&amp;#8217;t do it under four hours but it is still a pretty fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we took Hannah on her first real hike with Whitney and Gurgi. We walked the 7.5 mile loop at Walker Ranch and it aeems i wore everyone out: dogs, daughter and wife. Towards the end J and I got annoyed with each other but worked it out. We may be in trouble when Hannah learns the art of manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner I went out to Bo and threw the saddle on him for a few laps. He did well, I can almost get him to do a few large circles at a gallup. Got bit up by moaquitos, we need to bring some bug spray out to keep with the tack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this I am getting some quality one one one Hannah time. Litterly, she is using me as a pillow before I put her down for the night. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it helps her sleep through the night better or not, but I like to spend this quit time with her just reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was definatly in the moment this weekend. I&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to San Diego this weekend and Hannah had a blast. I think it wore her out a little bit though. She got to meed Scott and Sarah&amp;#8217;s new puppy, Aggie and she got to see her Grandma Cheryle and Grandpa Paul while Julie and I went to a wedding. She had a great time with her grandparents and then On Sunday we took her to the San Diego Cove.</description>

      <description>It hot here for the 29th day in a row so I thought I would give the pups a break from the hundred degree days we have been getting in Erie. I brought them into the office and took this picture on one of their breaks outside. It&amp;#8217;s really cool that I can bring them to work with me. I doubt that I could ever do that at companies like Amgen.</description>

      <description>Hannah was super tired last night. I took her for a walk with the pups last night while Julie went out to Mr. Bo. She fell asleep about halfway into it and then didn&amp;#8217;t want to go to sleep when we got back.
She is pretty funny when she tries to keep herself awake. It seems like she gets so tired that she gets more energy and excited so she can do more things before she crashes.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We had a great weekend, even though we missed Julie. While she was off in Cancun relaxing Hannah spent the weekend with my parents showing them her tricks: waving, standing and taking baby steps. When she wants something she is willing to let go of her support and take a step or two towards the object of her desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the bricks returned and the yard work done and even got Hannah some new sandals for the summertime. Even with my parents here, it is hard to take care of Hannah by myself. THe longer Julie was gone I noticed more little things that she did which are easy to take fro granted. I was glad to pick her up last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, Dad got the truck running again, apparently when I changed the plugs and wires I crossed cylinders 1 and 8). Dodge has a strange firing order on the &amp;#8217;97 Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things to do this week before we leave for San Diego:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix the electrical (Measure the diameter of the pvc pipe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset the middle sprinkler range at the top of the backyard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;reset the bricks where the ants dug sand up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;reset the bricks around the edge where it has settled a quarter&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a strange feeling to go over the M&amp;amp;S&amp;#8217;s last night with Julie gone and myÃ‚Â parentsÃ‚Â watching Hannah. Hannah did great last night. WeÃ‚Â wentÃ‚Â through her usual routine of playing, eating, and shower. Since it was only 6:30 Papa Rosa and I went to the auto part store to get a new distributer cap andÃ‚Â rotorÃ‚Â thingy. Hannah came with us and took a light nap on the way there. The auto store woke her up though and she stayed awake until we got home. She wasn&amp;#8217;t quite all the way tired so Mom played with her till she put her to bed. She stayed down all night! It was reported to me yesterday that she can stand on her own and take three or four steps at a time all by herself. I&amp;#8217;ll have to get a video of that. I can maybe post it on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah woke up this morning is a very smiley mood. She drank her bottle in less than ten minutes and then started crawling all over me and looking at the animals. We got up and went downstairs to get breakfast ready and Momma Rosa made Papa Rosa feed Hannah. She&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Silver Rush MTB race was fun but I didn&amp;#8217;t finish. Grrr, I am annoyed with myself for taking to many breaks. I got to the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; way point in 4 hours and 10 minutes and the cutoff time was four hours. Next year besides the AM Train I will need to ride the HA (High Altitude) Train alot more. I plan on going up to the colorado trail between Frisco and Breckenridge and doing that as an out and back. It won&amp;#8217;t be fifty miles but it should be close to forty and its at a decently high altitude. Riding or pushing a bike at 11,000+ feet is pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news; she is waving, almost saying Hi and crawling with a peg leg. She uses one leg to crawl like normal and the other leg is used with the foot flat on the ground to propel her around. She is pretty quick when she seesÃ‚Â somethingÃ‚Â she wants to go after like Momma, the dogs food dishes or the Bella the cat. Her legs are getting a bit of balance in them. I have seen her stand up unassisted, with no hands, for almost 20-30 seconds and she is taking&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmm, last night was an interesting night. You would NOT go down for momma, even when she took you to bed with her. I took over around 10:30 or so and we sat in the rocking chair in the corner of your room. Last week I put a night light in there so that you don&amp;#8217;t wake up in a total black out. Last night you discovered light and shodows. For almost thirty minutes you watched me make one handed shadow puppets and move my head around. Then, I tried to get you to do them. after a few minutes of me holding your arm out into the light you started to move it around. I think you made the connection beteen the movement of your arm and the movement of the shadow on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also like to be talked to. You were interested in the shadows on the ceiling so I told you all about what we were doing with the shadows (making one handed puppets); then, when you started rubbing your eyes I started talking you down to sleep. I told you about the geometry of trees (really all plants). How the branches off the main stem can&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Very busy this week. I did an AM Train on monday but haven&amp;#8217;t ridden since then. GOAL: make to the 1&amp;frasl;2 way point in under 4 hours!
When Julie is sick and Hannah can&amp;#8217;t have unlimited access to her momma, Hannah gets cranky. She is getting very curious about her environment, crawling around and trying to pull herself up on all kinds of things. I need to do the stair gates because she likes to climb.</description>

      <title>Her Latest Trick</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-07-14-her-latest-trick/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2008-07-14-her-latest-trick/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannahs MOST FUN THING TO DO, lately, has been to pull herself up on something and then let go. She flaps her arms like a bird and tries to balance on two legs. The longest she can balance is for 10 &amp;#8211; 15 seconds. She is also starting to look at other objects that she can balance on and edge her self close to them. I can see her thinking, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll bet I can run to that before I fall!&amp;#8221; A little birdie is telling me that she will be walking before to long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also started saying &amp;#8220;OH!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is after we tell her &amp;#8220;NO!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its kinda funny. We are still workign on some basic signs with her: Eat, More, No, gentle Mamma and Pappa. Nothing back yet but I think she might be starting to get the communicaiton thing. She is sleeping well. What is working now is that she will go down with Julie around 8:30 &amp;#8211; 9:00 and then I&amp;#8217;ll take her into her crib when I come to bed, later. For the last few days she has been sleeping through the night until about 5:45am or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged about 120 miles last week, mostly on the AM&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Loneliness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh Hannah, you were so lonely last night. It broke my heart when I went into your room and you were sitting there looking at the little turtle lights and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I got the diaper situation in line and then rocked you back to sleep. It took a few position changes on your part, but we got you comfortable. Then, after you fell asleep, I held you a little longer so I could listen to the tiny snore that was coming from your cute little button nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little kiddo is getting bigger, but not so big just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really not a fan of riding a bike on the road, even commuter riding. Although, i was thinking today when I rode in that if I could ride three days a week that would save almost 120 miles of driving per week or:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6000 miles per year (assuming my company keeps us at only two weeks of vacation a year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 less fill ups for the Murano&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1350 less on gas per year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a lower resting heart rate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I saw five or six bannan peels on the side of the road when I was riding in, today they were all gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah started crawling for real this past weekend. It will be soon that she is standing up and running from support object to support object. She is getting also getting very vocal and has started to not like to sleep through the night 🙁
I did a training ride on Saturday, 25 miles on the colorado trail. I started from the Gold Hill Mine trailhead and went clockwise (if you are lookign east.</description>

      <title>Patio Done :: Hannah Almost Crawling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Patio is done, whew. Julie helped tremendously and I think it was more work than she realized. She was also able to take care of Hannah alot of the time so kudos to her for multi tasking. Cory helped to and its prolly because of him that we got done yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My estimated totals are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bricks and wall blocks moved &amp;#8211; 10,000 to 12,000 lbs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall foundation and road base moved &amp;#8211; 22 tons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason sand for paver leveling &amp;#8211; 2.5 tons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment rentals &amp;#8211; one paver saw for a day, one 225lb 14&amp;#8243; ground pounder rented twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned &amp;#8211; estimated wall block and pavers is not an exact science&amp;#8230; we have almost a pallet extra of rectangular pavers (but just the right amount of square pavers) and we have about &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a pallet of extra wall blocks. Next time I need to hire a day laborer to help move stuff from the front the back and seriously consider renting one of the hand powered front end loaders to help with moving/loading/excavating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hannah news she is standing like mad (with assistance) and can almost push herself up into a sitting position on her own. I give it a week ands she will be sitting up&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have had a hard time getting back to making regular posts since Vegas. I have also had a hard time getting in my training rides for the 50 mile MTB race coming up. I want to at least be able to finish it in under 7.5 hours.
Hannah is growing so fast now. All she wants to do is stand up. You can put her between the couch and the ottoman and she bounces back and forth moving all around until she plops down.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Busted in Vegas. It seems that people play jack 4 offsuit offline as well as online. Hah. Oh well, I guess that even though he was playing like a maniac, I should have thought a little more before calling his all in with only top pair after the flop. I played good other that that, there was just one other really bad call that I made. Until I lost to MR J4o I was up about $200, the pot with the maniac was the biggest pot I have ever been in before ($475) I am letting people draw too much I think and I could use a healthy dose of aggression to my game. Other times I bet the flop with what I thought was the best hand but didn&amp;#8217;t follow up on the turn and let one person get a straight and another person get to a flush draw. Hmm, need to start being more aggressive post flop when I play strong hands and hit part of the flop. That might give me more information if I bet or reraise when I am in position. Other that those types of hands (and the J4o) I played well from position. Had&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We felt and saw Hannahs fourth tooth on Sunday. She is getting closer to sitting up and, when sitting up, she is starting to lean forward in order to grab things that she wants. This morning, in bed, it was funny cause she would topple over and immediatly go into roll mode. Thats my girl &amp;#8230; she is already learning the proper way to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple gives a one year warranty for most of its products. My phone has been acting up so I took it in for some trouble shooting. They walked you through the usual steps of resetting the network connections and restoring the software but nothing really helped. People who were calling me still kept hearing echos on thier end. When I went back I was pleasantly surprised that the tech at teh Genius Bar just popped out my SIM card and swapped it into a new phone. This time I got the rubber condom for protection, but no belt clip for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lilac Circle Papas are headed to Vegas thursday night. I want to play tight/aggressive and double up my money. I am taking three buy ins for the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NL game and expect that good things will&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This late night Hannah fun is from two days ago. I had my server off for a few days so I am posting it now. She went to bed with Momma and woke up a bit earlier than usual, around 10:15pm. When she woke, boy was she ever conversational. She was talking and talking and just talking to herself i think. She talked to me all the way through her diaper change. She talked to the computer as I was shutting it down. She talked to Bella the cat when we let her out into the garage, to hunt mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since she was conversational I took her into the nursery and sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to her. Well, I sang the two verses I could remember over and over. Curious as ever, she started feeling my throat while I was singing. I think it helped her find her voice cause she started singing too. She sang and hummed and cooed her way to sleep on my right shoulder instead of the usual left side. This time, when I put her down in the crib she barely made a sound. She just rolled onto her side and that was that, off like&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You and momma went to bed early, around 8:00 or so. I watched &amp;#8216;Planet Earth&amp;#8217; for a little while and then I heard you at 10:00. You were happily awake. We went into the laundry room and got you set up with a fresh, dry diaper. The whole time you were talking and looking at stuff. Did you like the shadows made by the batheroom light? Were you trying to tell me that you were happy? Then we went into the routine fall asleep mode. I start by putting you on my left side with my arms keeping you close to my shoulder. We walk around for a little bit and then, because you are getting so big now, I sit down in the rocker. Now you stop talking and start getting comfortable. First you rest your little head on top of my shoulder. Then you nuzzle into the side of my neck. You are so warm and pleasent smelling, I softly hum a little bit to lull you under but you like to fight sleep for a bit. This time, the only sounds you make are getting comfortable sounds. When my neck doesn&amp;#8217;t twork out for you, you sink lower&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode into work today to get some extra riding in. Its weird, but when it is colder the air seems fresher or something. This morning and there was lots of tailpipe to smoke. To bad that&amp;#8217;s not what I like to smoke. Anyways, ride stats are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Distance &amp;#8211; 37.52 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip Time &amp;#8211; 2:10:39 hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average Speed &amp;#8211; 17.23 mph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Speed &amp;#8211; 35.80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I think I&amp;#8217;ll get up a little early and try to get over 60 miles in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah news: I went in to get her at her usual wakeup time of 5:15 and she was sleeping on her Stomach! That&amp;#8217;s huge for little miss &amp;#8216;I do not like to spend any time on my tummy&amp;#8217; 🙂 She is also able to stand up for a short time if you lean her against the couch. Yay! I am sure she will want to go snowboarding with us next year 😉 Julei and I have started practicing her crawling coordination. What is that you ask? Well let me tell you. We put Hannah on her back and one of us takes the legs while the other takes the arms. Then we alternate each side in a pseudo crawling motion. It&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Went for a training ride around Anthem and Vista Ridge this morning. Started out on a little loop. But ehen I came around by Bo&amp;#8217;s stable I decided to keep going up to highway 52. Over to county line road and then back through Anthem turned my ride into a big loop. I did a second smaller loop for good measure and made it back home before ten am.Ã‚Â

      <description>I rode to work yesterday. Total ride time was 2:22. Total distance was ~37 miles. If I worked in the loop near Vista Ridge I should be able to make it more than 50 miles. Felt pretty good, I averaged a bit better than 15mph. Will need many more of these before the silverton 50.
We got up early this am and took Hannah to the balloon launch at the VR clubhouse.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hanna woke up earlier than usual last night, around 10:30. Julie was aleady asleep so I went to go comfort her. I think she had a scary dream and woke up all alone. She does not like to be alone right now because she calmed down when I changed her diaper and lulled her back to sleep on my shoulder while rocking gently in the corner of her room. I can only try to describe how pleasant I&amp;#8217;d felt to have her nuzle her face into the crook of my shoulder and her left arm around my neck. She was warm, content and I think she just wanted someone there while she fell back to sleep. I hope she had better dreams the second time around. Maybe she saw Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was a good one. One that, upon reflection, I can look back on and say that life is really good. Saturday we got a few things around the house done and I went out to Bo while Julie spent quality time with Hannah and took Whitney to the Vet &amp;#8211; she has an ear infection. In the afternoon, I got a workout in at the gym. I rode for 30&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No traveling, nothing urgent to do this past weekend and good time spent with Hannah made the weekend alot of fun. It started on Friday night when we got all the children together for some dinner. They were very cute playing together. Then we had some Wii time, Smash Bros &amp;amp; Martio Kart. A couple of beers and then off to bed.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up pretty early and were ready to go hiking on Saturday morning. Just around Betasso Preserve loop ~3.2 miles. Hannah did good on her second training hike, She fell asleep towards the end. On our way back home we stopped for an early lunch at the farmers market. Then it was off to home for a mid day nap. It was a very good nap. Woke up around 3:00 or so and played with Hannah some more while Julie went out to see Mr Bo. We had dinner and put Hannah to bed at her usual time and then watched a movie, Juno. It was pretty good. It gave me an idea for how to manage my Netflix queue. Instead of waiting for them to recommend a move for me, I just look at what is currently&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yesterday Marie reported that Hannah popped her first tooth. That explains why she was so cranky Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in San Francisco. Yeah, she only has 19 more to go 😉
On tap for tonight, after Julie gets home from picking up the Volvo is Wii at the Heathers, I think Cory got the Super Mario Carts game and I just got the Super Smash brothers game so it should be fun.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a cold wet ride in to Boulder. It was about 40 degree when I left Erie and not raining. By the time I got to Lafayette it had started raining and by the time I came into Boulder it was snowing. I wish my truck was running today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Just got back from four days in San Francisco and I found out how hard it is to work and watch Hannah. I think she is getting bored pretty easily now. I noticed that she is happy entertaining herself for a little while, maybe half an hour. Then she wants some attention or different stimulation. In the mornign she would have her naps and play sessions and I could get some stuff done but then she would get fussy. By the time I went out to meet Julie for lunch she would be a bit cranky. Then I would put on the Bjorn and one of her hats (tangent: i got her a really cute reversible green and white / light green and pink flowers hat that straps on below her chin) and out we would go. As soon as we got into the elevator she would start smiling at anyone near&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, running out the door to work Julie stopped me and said, &amp;#8220;Hey come here I have something for you to do.&amp;#8221;Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reply was to sigh and so ok, what is it. SInce my mind was already out the door on my day, and the noon bike ride I had planned.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;#8221; come upstairsÃ‚Â with me&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave me Hannah when I got to the top of the stairs. Holding my daughter I followed her in to the office where she got her camera and then led us into theÃ‚Â nursery. &amp;#8220;We are going to take pictures of the Giraffes for your Aunt Lulu,&amp;#8221; she said. A light bulb went off in my mind.Ã‚Â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sat Hannah in her boppy and took a seat next to her. The Giraffes are thirty two years apart in age but you can tell that they are related. Mine has faded white fuzzy skin, ragged hair on its main and dilapidated horns on top of its head. It is still standing but it kind of leans over to the one side now.Ã‚Â Hannah&amp;#8217;sÃ‚Â Giraffe is a little taller, completely full of stuffing and bright, bright yellow. My giraffe stood next&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;p&gt;
    On Friday, when I fed Hannah dinner, she started a new behavior. When I gave her the sign for &amp;#8216;eat&amp;#8217; and showed her the spoonful of baby food she opened her mouth like a little birdie. It was very cute. She did it until she got full or tired of the repetition. Watching her this past weekend I saw that she is starting to give signs of wanting but I don&amp;#8217;t think she knows she is doing it yet. Besides opening her mouth like a little bird, sheÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â has moments when she only wants Momma :)Ã‚Â
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Good weekend, great weather. We went for two &amp;#8216;hikes&amp;#8217; this weekend with Hannah. Last Saturday Julie and I got up early, went to breakfast at the farmers market on 11th St. Later we went up to the Bebaso trail/loop west of Boulder. Hannah first hike was fun. She fell asleep for the first half but was awake for the last mile or so.Ã‚Â On Sunday we went with Cory, Jen and Mason and walked around on the Boulder Creek Path. Both hikes were great little warmups and I look forward to some good backpacking with her.Ã‚Â

      <title>Hannahs Spring Weekend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Spring finally broke for good this past weekend. Hannah got to spend lots of time with her maternal grandparents. Paul and Cheryle drove up from Thousand Oaks for a long weekend. They watched Hannah while Julie and I cleaned the garage and patched all the cracks from the mud jacking. While I was turning on the sprinklers, Julie went out to ride Bo. Later that night we got a movie date night out of it while the grandparents put Hannah down to bed. From the &amp;#8216;report&amp;#8217; we got later that night she wasn&amp;#8217;t thrilled about not being put down by a regular (Me or Julie) but she rolled with it and let them calm her down and comfort her to lala land. For our date we went and saw 21, which i thought was ok but nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we got up early and Julie and I ran in the Canine Classic. It was fun, there were a ton of dogs everywhere and the weather was really nice. Not to hot, not too cold, just right for running 5 kilometers. After the race we went into Boulder for brunch and then went home for a nice mid afternoon siesta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>No tooth but I saw Eels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No tooth for Hannah yet. She was really happy this morning though and is still drooling like a mad baby and I am pretty sure that she does not have rabies. That means she is still getting closer to popping that first tooth. SHe is eating pretty well now, she really likes fruit. Julie told me that she ate the whole serving of bananas this morning.Ã‚Â It seems Hannah likes bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the eels show last night. Went with M my neighbor and a group of people. Was a good show at the Fox Theater in Boulder. A little crowded but atmosphere was pretty intimate and he puts on an entertaining show. He played a wide range of selections (old and new) and I found out that he is a really good drummer. Before the show they were playing the DVD that came out with his latest album. I saw that he also has a book so I found it on amazon this morning and placed an order. Should be an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It snowed today and I think that will hold up Cheryle and Paul. They stayed in Grand Junction last night and will get here today if there isn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Any day now we expect Hannah to pop her first tooth. She is gumming anythign she can get into her mouth like crazy. Her fist, frozen rubber things with bumps on it, even my fingers. She is starting to like the solid food thing; at least from the output perspective that I have. We have had her on rive and whole grain cereal for about two weeks now and Julie just introduced some fruit this past weekend.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Hannah is trying to &amp;#8216;train&amp;#8217; us 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night when I was putting her to bed she was fine if I held her, fine if I was giving here a little baby massage while lying in her crib on her side; but not fine if I stepped out of the room. I went to get something from the laundry room and she immediatly started crying. As soon as I came back into the room she stopped, but only for a second and then got louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took about ten minutes to relax her enough so that she was lulled into light sleep. I was able to slip out of the room then. I decided to give her five minutes to work things out for herself. She cried out a few times, each time getting softer and then sullenly went back to sleep. She stayed asleep until 1:30 or so when Julie took put her back down. Then she didn&amp;#8217;t wake us until 7:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dogs are still smarter than me, yesterday they got out of the yard and ran around the neighborhood like crazy boxers.Ã‚Â I got the other doggy fence from the basement and put it up so they&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I went to Ohio for Easter this year. Katie and Rob came down from Montana and then we Drove from Colorado to Cleveland with Hannah and the pups. Total time on the road was right around 48 hours there and back. It only took about twenty hours to go city to city. Weather wise it was pretty good. On the way there we hit some snow in Chicago that got worse the closer we got to Cleveland but that was all.</description>

      <description>I was carrying Hannah around and we were looking at stuff in the garage. She has been reaching for things for a few days now and recently she is getting her coordination dialed in. That is, she is getting what she reaches for. I was looking at my mountain bike when she reached out and grabbed a spoke on Julies road bike that is hanging from a hook. As I moved away she kept holding on.</description>

      <description>I went up to eldora on Sunday afternoon with Cory. First couple of runs were ok, but then it started to get fun. When you are in the trees and it starts to snow it is the most magical time. Even better than moonrise/moonset.
We made our way to the west side, Corona, and tried a few tree runs. All the way over, riders left, seemed a little rutty so we tried the trees just after the path gets going and they were alot of fun.</description>

      <description>I finished up the whole house humidifier wednesday and it is working normally. Julie notices a difference, and i can too. I think it is more noticeable in the morning. Since the humidifier is only on when the fan or heater is on I am running the fan to circulate air in the evenings.
I still need to upload my pictures and put them into a howto post.</description>

      <description>I am trying to read the three Bourne books by Robert Ludlum. I just can&amp;#8217;t seem to get into them. I thought the first book was kinda slow or dull or both. I am about halfway through the second one and it is just dragging on and on while I don&amp;#8217;t really care about any of the characters. I haven&amp;#8217;t ever read anything by Ludlum before but for all the books he sold I expected a better story that this.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;#8217;t go up to Winterpark this weekend. I tried to make it up to eldora but that didn&amp;#8217;t happen either. We did take Hannah to the zoo. I got the whole house humidifier installed and played some wii after Hannah went to sleep.
We also got a kid carrier for Hannah, a sherpani I think. Hiking this spring should be fun. One way to make sure it happens enough is to put it on my google calander and then send invatations/reminders to other interested parties.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an movement to ban labels on milk. Speaking from an individual consumerist position we have stopped buying milk that is not labeled &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin&#34;&gt;rBST &amp;amp; rBGH&lt;/a&gt; free. This started when my wife and I were thinking about conceiving and has continued now that our daughter is breastfeeding. Why is it important for us to know where our food comes from? In the scientific sense of natural, I would rather drink a product that comes to me the way it has for hundreds of years. Even if, as Monsanto claims, there is no detectable difference between milk produced from rBST/BGH and non-rBST/BGH cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, I want to know how my food got to me, not just what is in it. I think this started when I read the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Food_Nation&#34;&gt;Fast Food Nation.&lt;/a&gt; It is wrong for our government to deny dairy farmers who use non-rBST/BGH cows the ability to differentiate from farmers who utilize the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA&#34; title=&#34;Recombinant Technology&#34;&gt;recombinant technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA&#34; title=&#34;Recombinant Technology&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; After all, the labels are more than just marketing &amp;#8230; they are providing insight into the process used to produce the product; much like how the ingredients list all the substances used to make up the product, it is information relevant to how&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It was snowing today. Not to much, just a few inches but it was cold outside so I decided to go to the Gym. Getting up at 5:15 is no to hard once your body is moving. After quickly going through my weights routine I headed over to the stationary bike. After last Friday it made me feel nostalgic for Ventura County&amp;#8217;s weather.
On a stationary bike I just set the resistance and started peddling.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have fond memories of learning to mountain bike at Sycamore. We visited Newbury Park last weekend so Hannah could get some time with her maternal grandparents and so Julie could see some of her girlfriends in the area. So on Friday afternoon I found myself with several hours to kill. Earlier I sent an email to a Newbury Park bike shop asking about any rental mountain bikes they might have but had not hear back from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my father-in-law has a rigid frame bike that looked like it was capable enough. After fiddling with the gears for a bit, trying to get the full range, i gave up and just made sure I had granny gear since I doubted I would be going full speed over the rough patches. I found an old helmet and off I went. I rode to the Wendy Dr trail head and started down. It was beautiful &amp;#8230; so green and sunny and the temperature was just right at 70. They must have gotten a lot of rain recently. I started on my usual warm up loop and found that they are now letting bikes go on the Hidden Pond trail. This started off good&lt;/p&gt;</description>
