      <description>I was watching Skyfall again and the bad guy is an actor that I knew I had seen before. But where. This time the connection was someone in the shadows. As soon as outgoing M said it the second time I made the connection and I saw him walking in No Country For Old Men.</description>

      <title>Holiday Songs</title>

      <description>This year Hannah had her Holiday concert. She and her class were organized and on tempo with the music. Along with her questions about Santa she is truly beginning to understand the world she moves through. I liked how she fiddled with her antlers, I am sure I ould have done the same if I could have even kept them on my head.
I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod.</description>

      <title>Avoid Fandango</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-12-18-avoid-fandango/</link>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-12-18-avoid-fandango/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my second experience with Fandango I like them even worse. We won&amp;#8217;t focus on the lack of usability on their website but to say that it was less than optimal and more than painful to get the information I was trying to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this sub par experience with them is the Google Offers (I&amp;#8217;m not sold on the whole internet coupons as a value proposition for myself either but Julie is a bit more trusting than I am) Fandango tickets we purchased and can&amp;#8217;t use because they are expiring before we can use them at a different theater later this week. We already made plans to meet other folks at a specific theater but unfortunately for us crapdango tells me that &lt;strong&gt;Online Ticketing Not Available for this Theater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh, so let me get this straight, they sell movie tickets but when I want to buy them they can&amp;#8217;t sell them to me. I recall the first time I balked because they tried to force me to register for an account and charge me an extra couple of dollars for tickets. I guess I&amp;#8217;m at a loss to the value they provide. I have never had a hard time getting tickets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Land Of Pleasant Surprises</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hannah and her Volvo</title>

      <description>This morning while I was doing yard work Hannah did some work of her own. She went to the store (for real this time) and packed for camping. Now we are off to the store for some more sprinkler system parts and wood for the garden boxes.
Watching her at play is educational for me. I think my challenge as a parent is to disguise my advice (tips, tricks and my accumulated knowledge) in a way that she will accept it as her own idea.</description>

      <description>I was looking for something to watch on netflix tonight and came accross the following category:

Up until now I have been unaware of the &amp;#8220;Feel Good Good Talking Animal TV Shows&amp;#8221; Genre. Finding it made me smile.
I really like the Pingu animations. I like to watch them with Hannah because she really gets why it&amp;#8217;s funny. I have never seen someone focus so intently as she does.</description>

      <description>Anticipating the Avatar movie. i hope it lives up to the marketing.
Hannah is making cookies with MamaRosa and PapaRosa at the Macks and Santa is on his way. its her second xmas and i think she kinda gets it. Tommorow should be fun.
[[Update]]
Good story, awesome effects. The 3d was really cool but not the whole movie. Enjoyed the story and got some ideas for my own. If I can&amp;#8217;t find a decent employer this year, maybe I can write a decent story of my own.</description>

      <description>J, RK, and L saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tonight. It was a really good movie. Very effective and subtle cg and a good story line.
I find that post Hannah some movies affect me differently. The scene where BB sits and watches his daughter in the crib was really touching; I think because I have done that with Hannah. There is nothing more magical than watching your daughter sleeping and completely at peace.</description>
