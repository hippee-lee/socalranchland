      <description>While distracted from fixing bugs, I made The Red River. Not the HBO version, the book version. The book is always better than the movie / tv show.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m following the progress of Zurb&amp;#8217;s Foundation For Apps. They have published some ideas related to erasing the difference between native mobile apps and web apps on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Summary Of The Doodle Book</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2014-03-21-summary-of-the-doodle-book/</link>

      <description>I finished the Doodle Revolution book this morning by Sunni Brown. Overall it taught me that questions are about systems, processes or comparisons (sometimes comparing one system or process to another). These questions lead to meetings with communication, understanding (or lack thereof) and ideas. The addition of those three things lead to answers.</description>

      <title>My Custom Shelf</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2014-03-19-my-custom-shelf/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;customization-is-diy&#34;&gt;Customization Is DIY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a custom shelf and didn&amp;#8217;t think any of the usual suspects would have something like I wanted in the price range I wanted. So I&amp;#8217;m going to make my own. Like cooking, the more I do for myself the closer I get to what I want. Perhaps this is because economies of scale must make compromises and I have to make compromises when I dim (do it myself). It&amp;#8217;s just that I can supply the skill and choose which compromises I care about most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I like doing art with Hannah. She thinks I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing. All I do is fallback on the things I know and make the rest up as I go along.
Chalk is my favorite medium to play outside together with her.</description>

      <description>Time to run and play
And I hope today was good
Full of summer fun
  Life is a cycle and this is something I used to say to Hannah when she let me walk her into the schoolyard. The sketch was an idea I jotted down about how to visualize life in a personal context.     We start our cycles and learn whats fun and not fun.</description>

      <title>Thing As Interface</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about why I don&amp;#8217;t want my apps to make me think. I&amp;#8217;m there to do a job and move on. If I have to change this, fix that or connect to the network because the app forgot that it just got the data for this screen a minute ago before I switched apps to check my calendar; then the app is making me do more mental work than I budgeted for the task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zumbox is winding down and I&amp;#8217;m iterating through updated versions of my resume and cover letter. I&amp;#8217;ve been testing the water around TO this week and there are opportunities for sure. Doing the new browser client in AngularJS was very fortuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to take an Angular path to some more JS enlightenment*Â &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-My-Experience-With-AngularJS-The-Super-heroic-JavaScript-MVW-Framework.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s highs for me were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope, $scope and direct binding to the DOM elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directives as reusable widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory services with the builder pattern for extending an objects functionlity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaYaaq2Miw&#34;&gt;Promises, Promises&lt;/a&gt; andÂ &lt;a href=&#34;http://taoofcode.net/promise-anti-patterns/&#34;&gt;Promise Anti-Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still going up (and down ðŸ™‚ ) &amp;#8211; every time I drop into the angular source code to trace or debug issues I am treated to a mind expanding experience. And it&amp;#8217;s very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cork Board Layout</title>

      <description>I was laying a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. My constraints were:
&amp;#8211; grid like structure
&amp;#8211; on a cork board medium
&amp;#8211; one center of focus
&amp;#8211; even (ish) distribution
&amp;#8211; minimum effort today
Physically doing the layout made me wish I had css3 or iOS auto layout to assist and tweak. It only took four tries ( including previous prototypes ) with some help from my two trusty assistants to get it the way I wanted it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning Hannah and I did some glitter art. It was inspired by her &amp;#8216;discovery&amp;#8217; of some packets of glitter I found while cleaning the garage last weekend. She &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217; them on my workbench in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each took charge of one paper but helped each other decorate and gave advice on the art direction for the others project. I&amp;#8217;ll leave it up to you to guess who&amp;#8217;s is who&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Future Actions ( in your computer interface )</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next user interface will combine motion with action. Most of the &amp;#8216;action&amp;#8217; will be spoken in the way an executive gives orders to the minions. Copy this, save that and put the other thing over there, oh yeah, when I finish this, remind me to do the other thing before I get distracted by shinty Internet things. All desired actions will Â be spoken aloud in conversation. You know people like me whom in the middle of a problem talk it through. Yeah, these additions to ourinterface will be great for us. ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2013-04-09-brand-me/</guid>
      <description>I started putting thought online and figured that was it. It would be easy to make it look good and easy to write well. Double ha on both of those. The writing is slightly easier (when I do it regularly) if I write, rewrite and then rewrite it two more times. It helps to regularly read E.B White and Strunk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;The Elements of Style.&amp;#8217;
The look and feel of the site is harder, sure there are free and paid themes for WordPress but tweaking them only gets you so far.</description>
