      <title>An Easy Toolchain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I learned about tools from my dad. He used to fix everything us kiddos broke around the house and the cars and other engine driven things we used. I remember he had a method that included starting from the problem and working backwards through the solution. I spent alot of time bored out of my mind, holding his tools. Sometimes I was sent to get different tools but usually he brought a couple of different general purpose tools and was able to make due with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its funny, the more I learn about software and software development, even from a web slanted view, it all depends on the tools you use. It depends on the tools that work best with your style. I have been keeping my personal projects and org-mode files under version control at bitbucket with mercurial for a few years now and while not completely immersed in the distributed version control environment, I am drawn to the benefits of it. Namely being able to commit to my repo whenever and whereever I am internt access or no internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I ramp up the search for opportunities in the next phase there are a lot of things I still need&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Lucky Networked Time Machine RSS Feed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dad called last night because his Time Machine was not backing up. So tonight we had another mac session. Here is what we went covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time Machine: To check the status of time machine you can open &amp;#8216;System Preferences&amp;#8217; and click on Time Machine in the &amp;#8216;System&amp;#8217; row, second row from the bottom. Or, if you have the circular arrow with either the clock or the ! in it in the top bar of the screen you can just click that. Then I showed him how to make sure his Time Machine hard drive was mounted on his file system and if not, how to connect to it. Pretty easy,, we started a back up going and moved onto other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad wanted the pictures from the Cool Hannah Pics web page the we keep with mobile me. He had figured out how to download them one at a time by going to each picture, clicking the download link and then, after it downloaded, in the downloads window he would click the magnifying glass to &amp;#8216;Open in Finder.&amp;#8217; Then from finder he could drag it into iPhoto. &amp;#8220;Very good!&amp;#8221; I was proud of him and congratulated him for his investigative efforts. Then I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Printing Labels with Address Book and Sorting Email in Mail</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Book&lt;/strong&gt;: Mom needs some labels printed out so we started by selecting some contacts in the address book to print and setting up some preset Avery labels by label number. The workflow is as follows: Select one or more contacts to print, then choose File &amp;gt; Print. In the print dialog that pops up choose Mailing Labels as the Style and the Layout option. Now you can specify the page (We chose Avery Standard because they are printing on normal 8.5 x 11 paper) and then the label id number: 8160. WHen he did a test print of 10 contacts on a scrap piece of paper he found out that the left margin was off so we set up a custom label that was almost like the preset. We made note of the Margins: Top, Left, Right and Bottom and the gutters (vertical and horizontal space between individual labels), the number of rows and columns. Since the preset had the incorrect left margin we chose &amp;#8220;Define Custom: as the page and put in the noted top, bottom, right and gutterÃ‚Â measurementsÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â preset.We setÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â columnsÃ‚Â at two and the rows at 5. Ã‚Â Then since it was the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Papa Mac Session: Right Click Everything</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a brief synopsis of what we did tonight using yuuguu to share screens and learn about basic mac functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SELECTING ALL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command + a (command is the apple key with the squiggly shape on it next to the space bar) will select all the items in the application that has focus. So if you have e folder like &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos&amp;#8217; opens via the Finder it will select all of the photos in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT MENU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control + left mouse click will bring up a context menu. This is the same as a right click from the mouse. Wen you bring up a context menu the options in the context menu are dependent on the application that has focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMBINING ACTIONS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can combine both of these actions to do things. For example, last night you wanted to delete all the pictures in the &amp;#8216;Scanned Photos.&amp;#8217; I had you select them all with [command + a] and then send them all to trash by right clicking on a selected (highlighted in blue in your case) to bring up the context menu and choocing/clicking on send to trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIGHT CLICKING:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right clicking EVERYTHING is a good way see what actions you can do. You can learn alot about&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trouble Shootin</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-02-02-trouble-shootin-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trouble shooting with dad; tonight&amp;#8217;s session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with iPhoto, we went over some basic things to get started. I showed him navigating in the iPhoto app itself. We went to one of the recent items and looked at the pictures there, the photo library and an album that already existed. Then, I had him make a new photo album, multi select several photos and add them to the new album. Then we renamed the newly created album. Next we made a slide show from the photo album. We selected all the pictures in the new album &amp;#8216;chris&amp;#8217; and modifed some of the slideshow settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we moved on to trouble shooting the scanning issue. First, we made sure all images in the scanned photos folder had been imported into iPhoto, then we deleted the old scans. The HP Scan software was having trouble connecting to his scanner so I deleted the printer and re-added it using the system preferences &amp;#8211;&amp;gt; print &amp;amp; fax. This re-installed the drivers for his printer. Next, we went through the scanning procedure that he is already familiar with: start HP Scan, preview image, choose saving options and scan the photo. We both scanned and saved a photo&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It is almost Thanksgiving and as I start to reflect on all of the things I have to be thankful for, I cannot forget this one. Were it not for my Dad&amp;#8217;s many years of hard work and dedication to his family I would not be where I am today.
I can&amp;#8217;t say it in enough way&amp;#8217;s and sometimes the simplest way is the best, &amp;#8220;Thanks Dad, for everything!&amp;#8221; Congratulations and I hope you enjoy your retirement, you have earned it.</description>
