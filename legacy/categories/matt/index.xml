      <description>You can never escape your past and sometimes it gives you a happy return. Hannah found an old Ohio flag in my closet. I think it&amp;#8217;s from college but can&amp;#8217;t be sure.&amp;nbsp;
She had all kinds of questions why did I have it. Where was it from and what was it for and could she hand it up somewhere. When she stopped to take a breath I told her that I thought it was a great idea.</description>

      <description>While distracted from fixing bugs, I made The Red River. Not the HBO version, the book version. The book is always better than the movie / tv show.&amp;nbsp;
Hannah&amp;#8217;s lined up nicely with mine: ﻿

      <description>Think for me  Focus on closing your eyes.
Focus, and stay perfectly still.
Focus, calm your mind.
Rest your body. And go to sleep. A smile does wonders for the reception of my delivery.  Lay down still.
Close your eyes, and rest.
Your mind. Sleep.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a variation on the &amp;#8216;play with me&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;what should we do?&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;what game can we play?&amp;#8217; questions that I get asked with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;customization-is-diy&#34;&gt;Customization Is DIY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a custom shelf and didn&amp;#8217;t think any of the usual suspects would have something like I wanted in the price range I wanted. So I&amp;#8217;m going to make my own. Like cooking, the more I do for myself the closer I get to what I want. Perhaps this is because economies of scale must make compromises and I have to make compromises when I dim (do it myself). It&amp;#8217;s just that I can supply the skill and choose which compromises I care about most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I like doing art with Hannah. She thinks I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing. All I do is fallback on the things I know and make the rest up as I go along.
Chalk is my favorite medium to play outside together with her.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I do not base the measurement of myself on the number of times that I have fallen. I measure myself on two things: what was I doing when I fell and how did I get up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe she is moving on from kindergarten. It seems like the long days of home work and coordinating drop offs, pickups and school events coalesce into a brief moment that passes by while I was blinking.
Now she can read, to me. Now she can do math, well adding and subtracting. Now she has bff&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; although they are quite dynamic. Now she can dress herself for uniform days or free dress days and she knows better than info what the rules are.</description>

      <description>I started putting thought online and figured that was it. It would be easy to make it look good and easy to write well. Double ha on both of those. The writing is slightly easier (when I do it regularly) if I write, rewrite and then rewrite it two more times. It helps to regularly read E.B White and Strunk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;The Elements of Style.&amp;#8217;
The look and feel of the site is harder, sure there are free and paid themes for WordPress but tweaking them only gets you so far.</description>

      <title>The Land Of Pleasant Surprises</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We went to the zoo this morning for the annual trick-or-treat session. It was a little crazy with amostt 20 people and over half of us kiddos. This doesn&amp;#8217;t count grown up kiddos, only kiddos of legal age.
There were a few dramatic moments but overall thhings went pretty smoothly and we stopped at Cinzetti&amp;#8217;s Resturaunt for lunch. There is no better place to go with 10+ hungery, sugar overloaded kiddos.</description>

      <title>When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;</title>

      <description>&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_2421&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;[&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2421&#34; title=&#34;Hannah&#39;s Dragon Story&#34; src=&#34;http://192.241.192.98/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CIMG0246-300x228.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hannah&#39;s Dragon Story&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;228&#34; /&gt;](http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CIMG0246.jpg)&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Hannah&#39;s Dragon Story&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-spirit-of-that-memory-hannah-says&#34;&gt;In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the story forward, I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;The dragon was full and she lay down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This past weekend, I read a blog post that talked about a data type for &amp;#8216;me.&amp;#8217; The argument premise is that blogs are nice and all but they don&amp;#8217;t capture everything. They only capture a pseudo linear timeline of my output. However the data in my output is more than just what I am thing or recording on a blog. It includes emails, social media things and stuff on my computers that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a happy home upon a cloud anywhere.</description>

      <title>Happy Papa</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-06-19-happy-papa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%wppa%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=3%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &amp;#8211; it has been a great Father&amp;#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &amp;#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later she asked me, &amp;#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her &amp;#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then my friends are cool.&amp;#8221; She said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>[](http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hop.jpg)Hannah&#39;s first book that she actively tried to read herself. &amp;nbsp;
Hannah is not quite reading the Dr. Seuss book, &amp;#8220;Hop On Pop.&amp;#8221; Despite the drama that seems to have become part of the night night routine, I really like reading books with her. She has me point to the words and read them and then she copies me. She gets impatient when there are more than one sentence and uses the pictures as context and reads ahead.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your imagination is the preview to life&amp;#8217;s coming attractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never written down my goals and usually [day]dream ideas and things I want to do when I am driving. Thats likely why I am only an average driver and make myself ignore the phone &amp;#8211; there is only so much processing power my brain can do at one time. There are several variations to the same themes in my daydreams &amp;#8211; snowboarding every day, solving interesting and profitable problems, migrating around the world with Julie to see and do fun things and showing Hannah the things I like to do and have found to be useful to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book they say when you write your dreams down they become goals. It isn&amp;#8217;t just writing them down though the most successful people review them on an ongoing basis. Perhaps the problem to be solved is two fold; first, my brain needs something concrete to focus on and second, in order to make progress towards my dreams (which are hazy and and ill defined patterns in my stream of thought) the dream needs to be refined as I understand it better, as I know myself better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a post by someone who used to work at youtube a while back. He was talking about how most of the people he interviewed could not work on the DOM with-out jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like jQuery, it makes my job much, much easier even in the bastardized form I have to use it in. But, I liked the challenge and decided to work on the DOM with out a library, only using pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a few weeks of 2 hour nightly sessions to prototype, but I have something that runs. You can see the repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/hippeelee/ticker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I added a page called &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/ticker.html&#34;&gt;ticker&lt;/a&gt;. Its a bare bones demo and still more concept than practical utility, but I am having fun fleshing it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are more elegant tools and plug-ins that do the same thing. It feels good to do it for myself, just because I can. A bit like cultivating a home garden. Sure, I am not on the scale as the professionals and sure, my solution is not ideal. But that wasn&amp;#8217;t the point &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOM with images was there and now I can make them do what I want. I learned a&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am amazed at how long I went with out installing js2-mode on the netbook. To make it easy, I used the emacs default kit for saner defaults. Seems to work nicely.
I haven&amp;#8217;t been back to the orc battle since Christmas. I have been coding with the ruby koans and a fun little js project I am calling ticker. The idea is to use only pure js to make elements on a page tick, like a digital clock ticks its nuimbers away.</description>

      <description>The world is spinning and we are falling down the slope. Here are some pictures of before I took the plunge.
In the one picture I am getting ready to eat lunch on top of the world. The other is black snow left over after they did avalanche control. It was surprisingly fresh and bouncy after I dropped onto it.

      <description>Hannah is running a fever again. On the one hand I know her immune system is getting stronger and more prepared to fight the future. On the other hand I was looking forward to taking her skiing tomorrow While everyone else snowboards.
I hope a good night of child sleep is just the thing she needs to bounce back.
Here are some pictures of me her last weekend. We found a hill close to home and went sledding, made snow sculpture and snow angels.</description>

      <title>Early Season Loop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before the storms roll through and they open up the back part of Vasquez Cirque, there is a loop that will provide all the powder and trees that I want. And it is only an hour and a half from my front door. Once you get there you can relax and enjoy the ride, the loop automatically repeats until only the base case is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be comfortable on packed or powder. Moguls will be fun for you and you connect more turns than you miss. Trees are good, less people go there and the snow stays soft and the sound is muted. You are comfortable with the Cirque and the high speed (50-60 mph) run out down to the tree line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Pano Express and start down the catwalk. Take your time, everyone is going fast so they can make the traverse. We will not be going that far. Keep your eyes peeled riders left and take the turn off to Bella Fourche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are listening to something good, turn in up and head down the path. After you pass the snow fences, look for your line between the trees. Keep your eyes peeled, there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hannah is getting smart, strategic almost. She asks set up questions anticipating what my answer will be. Then she follows up with what she really wants.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.
She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.</description>

      <description>i started at the parking lot of my new job. behind the parking lot, there was a trail. i wanted to see where it came out. it exits on 119th and that means i can easily ride to work.
it was partly sunny and cool, around 60 degrees, but windy; so i rode up the the coal creek trail and took that until it ended up behind a golf course. along the way there was quite a bit of mud.</description>

      <description>After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.
i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.
I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods.</description>

it was a sunny almost 80 degree spring day. Hannah did soccer at Primrose and then we made cup cakes while we waited for Liu&amp;#8217;s take out to arrive.
Hannah needed a bath after helping Julie clean up the cake batter bowl.</description>

      <description>Anticipating the Avatar movie. i hope it lives up to the marketing.
Hannah is making cookies with MamaRosa and PapaRosa at the Macks and Santa is on his way. its her second xmas and i think she kinda gets it. Tommorow should be fun.
[[Update]]
Good story, awesome effects. The 3d was really cool but not the whole movie. Enjoyed the story and got some ideas for my own. If I can&amp;#8217;t find a decent employer this year, maybe I can write a decent story of my own.</description>

      <description>Julie took Hannah to her first theater movie: The Princess and the Frog.
Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&amp;#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&amp;#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said,</description>

It seems we can only use the conversion kit or the safety rail. They are not compatible together. I wonder how many times she will fall out before we take the conversion kit off amd use the safety rail.</description>
