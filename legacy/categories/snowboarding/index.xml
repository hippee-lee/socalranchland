&lt;p&gt;Hear and understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ever thing and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything will pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into time, it is all&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The world is spinning and we are falling down the slope. Here are some pictures of before I took the plunge.
In the one picture I am getting ready to eat lunch on top of the world. The other is black snow left over after they did avalanche control. It was surprisingly fresh and bouncy after I dropped onto it.

      <title>Early Season Loop</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2011-01-24-early-season-loop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before the storms roll through and they open up the back part of Vasquez Cirque, there is a loop that will provide all the powder and trees that I want. And it is only an hour and a half from my front door. Once you get there you can relax and enjoy the ride, the loop automatically repeats until only the base case is left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be comfortable on packed or powder. Moguls will be fun for you and you connect more turns than you miss. Trees are good, less people go there and the snow stays soft and the sound is muted. You are comfortable with the Cirque and the high speed (50-60 mph) run out down to the tree line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Pano Express and start down the catwalk. Take your time, everyone is going fast so they can make the traverse. We will not be going that far. Keep your eyes peeled riders left and take the turn off to Bella Fourche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are listening to something good, turn in up and head down the path. After you pass the snow fences, look for your line between the trees. Keep your eyes peeled, there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I put my bindings on the new snowboard. It&amp;#8217;s light! I think. I have big plans for the t6.
Hannah is getting smart, strategic almost. She asks set up questions anticipating what my answer will be. Then she follows up with what she really wants.</description>

      <description>if Mt St. Helens ever went cold enough for snow to collect it looks like a great back country bowl to ride.
I am watching NOVA and it infotms me that it erupted in 2007 but it was nore of a fizzle. then the seismic activity went quit. Cool.
it was warm today. Sunny with strong winds out of the north.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are birds chirping and I hear some muted &amp;#8220;whoo hoo&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; in the trees. There are 2-4 foot drifts in the trees and some thigh high drifts up on top of Vasquez Cirque. Yummy! The next run is Certainty and the ridge that gets the most snow, at least that&amp;#8217;s what I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly did. I opted out of dropping off the cornice that forms on the left side of the run for the grove of trees and really big rocks on the right. Up top the un-tracked powder was thigh high at least. When the slope is that steep the turns are so smooth and easy it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like turning on a snowboard. Once I got below the trees to where the rocks form a narrow gully, about ten feet wide I stopped to pick my line. Between the two largest rocks there is a nice channel that drops left, back into the Certainty slope and I had a very fast run out in the powder field below where I got some more beautiful turns. Then, below the next ridge, down underneath the tree line it was good, really good. Its a lot of work to get over there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saturday Ride</title>
      <link>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-03-28-saturday-ride/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice day, good weather. I got two nice drops into Vasquez Cirque. It was a little bumpy but there were still some calf/knee high patches and some decent turns leading into them. I need to think about dropping in less, unless I plan on going down one of the rocky chutes, I noticed that my turns feel more natural when I am reacting to the conditions of THIS turn rather than thinking about the next turn or the last turn or the really big rock that is coming up fast.Ã‚Â VisualizationÃ‚Â is still good at the top, it gives me a game plan but plans don&amp;#8217;t always turn out as you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got two runs down the baby park, popped some nice mellow airs on the baby five footers and the little rails and boxes are always fun. The biggest surprise was the carving and turns on my way back to winter park parking lot. I leaned into some gorgous s-turns and got really good extension both toe side and heel side. There was a bit of corn on the way down too, spring is fast approaching (the last week of weather aside). The last three weekends should be great for&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Greener Grass Symptoms</title>

      <description>It must be getting close to spring. Riding conditions were not ideal this morning. The Cirque was crusty and icy in places. Not at all like after a fresh snowfall. I hikes it once and then did a few groomer runs but carving was hard; there were to many people to carry speed through the turns safely.
Last week I watched some of re Mammoth videos from after their monster storm last month.</description>

      <description>Oh no&amp;#8217;s. US 40 was closed today! Oh well I got to come home and take Hannah sledding this afternoon. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be taking a second personal day tomorrow. I hope that Vasquez Cirque is open.</description>

      <description>Busy morning. Got tons of stuff done 🙂
Changed the oil in the Murano. I&amp;#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.
Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Rode up at Winterpark today with Jean-Francois. He rode to, no tellys for him today.
We started off in the fresh pow of Eagle Wind until they stopped blasting the Vasquez Circque. The mile+ hike is totally worth it. I haven&amp;#8217;t been on steeps like that since the Mammoth days and this was way less tracked because of the hiking required.
On the way home, he said we had to stop in Idaho Springs and get something called a &amp;#8216;mountain pie.</description>

      <description>Had a great day at the RMNP Bear Lake trail system. The only things missing were Julie and Hannah, but I think they might of been a little cold. This picture is of me hiking up to get some turns. Given my limited back country experience it was the first time in a long time that my heart rate was already going even before I dropped in, and, I only hiked halfway up the slope pictured in this picture.</description>

      <description>By Sunday morning, WInterpark had over two feet of fresh powder. I spent the morning riding Parsens bowl until that got really tracked up and the lift line got long. Then I made my way down the catwalk to Eagle Wind and rode in the trees till it closed. I found some thigh high stashes but most of it was mid calf or knee high.</description>

      <description>Well the truck made it to Mary Jane but it&amp;#8217;s cold up here, about -4 at 9:30am. Hopefully she&amp;#8217;ll start for me when she cools back down 🙂
Thoughts I had on the way up:
Blender a spindrop logo. A raindrop clear bit colored with a hint of rainbow on it&amp;#8217;s surface and slightly twisted. Around the drop there is an orange halo spinning.
The truck made it home. Had a good 3 hour session.</description>

      <description>I went up to eldora on Sunday afternoon with Cory. First couple of runs were ok, but then it started to get fun. When you are in the trees and it starts to snow it is the most magical time. Even better than moonrise/moonset.
We made our way to the west side, Corona, and tried a few tree runs. All the way over, riders left, seemed a little rutty so we tried the trees just after the path gets going and they were alot of fun.</description>
