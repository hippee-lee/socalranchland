      <description>You can never escape your past and sometimes it gives you a happy return. Hannah found an old Ohio flag in my closet. I think it&amp;#8217;s from college but can&amp;#8217;t be sure.&amp;nbsp;
She had all kinds of questions why did I have it. Where was it from and what was it for and could she hand it up somewhere. When she stopped to take a breath I told her that I thought it was a great idea.</description>

      <description>I saw a quote from the Facebook CEO:
 What, you think because you&amp;#8217;re paying Apple that you&amp;#8217;re somehow in alignment with them?
 Despite the admiration that has grown on me wrt how Facebook is lead and some of the things they are doing, my opinion of a company built solely around advertising is not based on how I think I align with them. It&amp;#8217;s how I think they align with me.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning Hannah and I did some glitter art. It was inspired by her &amp;#8216;discovery&amp;#8217; of some packets of glitter I found while cleaning the garage last weekend. She &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217; them on my workbench in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each took charge of one paper but helped each other decorate and gave advice on the art direction for the others project. I&amp;#8217;ll leave it up to you to guess who&amp;#8217;s is who&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sent this into &lt;a href=&#34;https://uncommon.cc&#34;&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;. They ask nice questions. Here is my answer to this one: **Is there something you&amp;#8217;ve lost that you&amp;#8217;ve never forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was three, maybe four years old in northeastern Ohio on an autumn afternoon. My parents made us rake up the leaves one afternoon. It was one of those magical afternoons. Where the sunlight filters down through the mature forest and motes of dust hang between oaks, silver maples and beech trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my shoes off, like I still do. There is nothing like the feeling of green grass and crunchy leaves underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Letting go is the hardest parental job to do. Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &amp;#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&amp;#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me.</description>

      <description>Ah, morning coffee and a nice walk over to the clubhouse. Much better today than yesterday; I was warmer and I felt better. I have about a hundred pictures posted to Google+ that I shared with Family and Friends. Let me know if you can&amp;#8217;t find them.
These are my favorite pictures of the morning.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julie had a long day yesterday. She is in her yearly crunch time with the end of the year stuff they do and yesterday she also had an appointment to disguise her true hair color from me 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Hannah got me up at 5:15ish in the morning and we saw her off and then played games. I took her to school and then finished up my testing on how to automatically convert a range of productivity documents into images or pdfs based on the file extension. It works and I hope it helps ease the users pain so that they can work with the tools their company provides for them in a way that interacts more seamlessly with our tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps thats what life should be about. Finding someones pain and creating a way to help deal with it. No one can take pain away. I can ease some of it away through acknowledgment; ven implied acknowledgement with a new workflow in the application, can go a long way to easing someones pain. And then they can redirect their efforts towards things that are important to them which will hopefully ease their pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I picked Hannah up from school and boy did&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cool crisp fall day. The storms of the day before had moved of to the east. We got up early with the sunrise and had a simple breakfast. Toast for me and scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and grilled chicken for you. Sitting around is never good for the soul so we went out to Mr BoBo. Hannah rode in the arena and you and Whitney chased him for a bit, like you always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back home and I took care of a few things around the house. Once I got done I joined you and Whitney out on the deck with my guitar. You sat in the sun the way you always did. Upright on your haunches you enjoyed the view across the valley all the way over to the mountains. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s just boxers but when you sat there stoically and sweetly it just killed me that you were in such dire straits. As I played the song you came over to sit next to me and sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was my birthday and the best wife ever was going to a rock show (Foo Fighters) with me, we set you&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah helped me pick out some new fish last night. Mr. Fishy died a few weeks ago when the tank had an oxygenation issue.
Since it was book club night Hannah and I had Mac n&amp;#8217; Cheese and then went to the pet store. She looked at all the fish but was more interested in the cats. She didn&amp;#8217;t want to choose I guided her into the Black Mollies and the Neon Tetras.</description>

      <title>Sunday Painting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hannah and I did some painting this afternoon. We did it out on the front porch because part of the process is making the paints, at least to start. The paint is some all natural stuff that is made from veggies and comes in powder form and gets mixed up with water. From past experience while painting with my daughter &amp;#8211; making up the paint is the least messy part of the session. But I told her that is why we were doing it outside, because it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if we are messy when we paint outside. We could just hose everything off after &amp;#8211; even her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah was a big help scooping the powder out and mixing in the water. OPnce we had the veggie paint set up we each did a few water colors and then she wanted black. Since we couldn&amp;#8217;t make black with the veggie paint Hannah finished up with the pre-mixed tube paints. When can I tell if her affinity with back is a goth tendency? Since I was not about to put paint all ovar myself to do handprints like she was I started trimming lilac shrubs. Then, when she was done I hosed Hannah, the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &amp;#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &amp;#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;span-style-color-333333-when-a-dragon-came-to-town-8230-span&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;When a dragon came to town &amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&amp;#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &amp;#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &amp;#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-spirit-of-that-memory-hannah-says&#34;&gt;In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the story forward, I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333;&#34;&gt;The dragon was full and she lay down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pura Vida</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first Internet access in almost a week. Pura Vida seems to be local slang for &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s all good&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;no worries.&amp;#8221; For sure that can describe the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monteverde was lush &amp;#8211; the biodiversity is amazing. I&amp;#8217;m going to have to re-read EO Wilsons book &amp;#8220;The Diversity of Life&amp;#8221; again because it was about places like this. We spent a day in the national park and our guide was very knowledgable of the flora and fauna. She especially liked birds. Besides the forest I saw signs of mountain biking in the area and would be very excited to come back and ride here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a too short stay in our almost private resort we drove down the coast to Manuel Antonio and went diving yesterday. Despite the murky visibility we saw a lot ot wildlife. Today the plan is to hike the national park here and end up at the beach. Hannah has gotten a lot of pool time but only a little beach time so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten some really good pictures but I can&amp;#8217;t post them yet. I&amp;#8217;m using Julies iPad to post this and besides the annoying typing corrections, it lacks the ability to post&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah was decorating a card for Mama Rosa and we told her to sign it. I told her the letters and she wrote them. It ended up on two lines because the blue and the brown decorations were in the way 🙂Hannah&amp;rsquo;s Signiture
In other news, Colorado&amp;#8217;s weather remains predictably unpredictable. Yesterday we had warm temps in the 80&amp;#8217;s and mostly clear and sunny sky&amp;#8217;s. Today it is raining with temps in the mid thirties, cloudy and I saw snow flakes in the air and on cars this morning.</description>

      <description>Hannah is running a fever again. On the one hand I know her immune system is getting stronger and more prepared to fight the future. On the other hand I was looking forward to taking her skiing tomorrow While everyone else snowboards.
I hope a good night of child sleep is just the thing she needs to bounce back.
Here are some pictures of me her last weekend. We found a hill close to home and went sledding, made snow sculpture and snow angels.</description>

      <description>Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.
Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &amp;#8220;What kind of glue?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&amp;#8221; Was her answer.
While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.</description>

      <description>It was most certainly out of the ordinary. And she wanted to go faster while yelling at me to let her do it on her own 🙂
It was almost as much work as riding the park and the pipe or carving out heelside turns that compliment the toeside. It was more fun than I have ever had on the slopes and I returned home a very proud papa.
At least equal to being hip deep in powder on a double black diamond above the treeline and more fulfilling than turning my first frontside 360.</description>

      <description>Last night was Halloween. Hannah was a Ladybug, and a very cute one at that.
She was a little funny at the Halloween party. I am not sure if it is because she fell off Bobo (Totally her parental units fault), the lack of a nap or something else. At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&amp;#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her.</description>

      <description>After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.
i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.
I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods.</description>

it was a sunny almost 80 degree spring day. Hannah did soccer at Primrose and then we made cup cakes while we waited for Liu&amp;#8217;s take out to arrive.
Hannah needed a bath after helping Julie clean up the cake batter bowl.</description>

      <description>Hannah is rapidly developin her language skills. if you can say it she will repeat it. she really likes sining her songs and demands that we listen to Hannah&amp;#8217;s music when driving in the car.
she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse.</description>

      <description>I tricked Hannah into going to her room friday night. She started out in my bed with mama and then i took her into her crib when i went to bed. It helped to hold her on my shoulder until she was uncomfortable and wanted to go to sleep. Then i asked her if she wanted to lie down in her crib. She said yes and was snuggling down, back to sleep in a few minutes.</description>

 singing an almost complete version of the abc&amp;#8217;s putting shoes on missing her mama in the morning completing full sentences that convey her understanding of more abstract concepts: Papa is Matthew, Mama is work. chasing Whitney around.</description>

      <guid>https://socalranch.land/posts/2009-07-18-chair-fixing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were putting Bella&amp;#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&amp;#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &amp;#8220;Bella work?&amp;#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1217&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1217&#34; title=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; alt=&#34;Bella Hunting&#34; src=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dsc_0427-300x199.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Bella Hunting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says &amp;#8216;Moma work&amp;#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &amp;#8216;Bella work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;Momma work.&amp;#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &amp;#8216;YES!&amp;#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &amp;#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&amp;#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &amp;#8216;Whats dis?&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Whats dat?&amp;#8217;&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_1215&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>We stopped at the outlets on our way home from the lilac circle Breckenridge weekend. Hannah was sound asleep when we got out of the car. I carried her into the first store and she heard the music, opened her eyes and started bobbing her head to the music for a minute. Then she closed her eyes and snuggled back down into my shoulder, fast asleep.</description>

      <description>Internet radio is so very convienient. Not having cable I can&amp;#8217;t watch the Cavs stay alive on TV. Since they don&amp;#8217;t offer me the opportunity to pay to watch on NBA.com, at least not that was easy to find, I fired up iTunes and there it is under the sports/talk internet radio section.
It reminds me of visiting my Grandpa I when I was little. He used to sit under he awning and listen to Indians games on a little portable am/fm radio while playing solitaire in the afternoon.</description>

This afternoon, she got all snuggly, and then her temp spiked to 104 for a few minutes. 10 long minutes later it was 102 and ten after that it was 100. Forty five minutes later it was normal, mama was home and Hannah was turning around yellng in that todler half speak that she makes up.

She did great! Going to school is hard, I forgot how much so from the last time. I guess I did it to myself, I could have turned the scholarship down, but then I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have these interesting shell scripting word problems to solve. They make a pretty good puzzle. And this class only goes for a few more weeks.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts that need to be written down so I don&amp;#8217;t forget them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hannah knows what work is, sort of. This morning she woke up late, 7:30. (Such a great little sleeper) And Her first words to me were &amp;#8220;Mama?&amp;#8221; I am pretty sure she was asking where was Momma. So I said, &amp;#8220;Mama&amp;#8217;s not here kiddo, she is gone already.&amp;#8221; To which she replied, &amp;#8220;work.&amp;#8221; Later she did it again when Julie was on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strange Animal signs. When Julie was going through the letter flashcards she did this cute elephant trunk simulation with her arm. I took a video of it but haven&amp;#8217;t processed the raw footage yet. I&amp;#8217;ll try to get it posted before we leave for North Carolina on vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we were on a date night last night Hannah hung out with Shaye. Apparently they spent a few minutes pointing to each other and saying their names. Hannah points at Shaye and says, &amp;#8220;Saye.&amp;#8221; (I think she is still working on some of her phonetics). Then Shaye points at Hannah and says, &amp;#8220;Hannah&amp;#8221;. Form what I heard this repeated for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning. Hannah is a little&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>Hannah wanted to read the cat book this morning. We read it twice. Her favorite part was where the little kitten pops out of the rain boot and I say, &amp;#8220;meow, meow, meow!&amp;#8221;
Then we went through the alphabet cards. She is picking up more hand gestures from school, plus she is part Itallian and Italians talk with their hands. At least my family does, you should see the holiday gatherings!</description>

      <description>When I was a child my mother and grandmother made something called pizza frit. It was really simple but really good. Fried dough rolled in sugar.
When I was in high school I would camp out in the back woods on my parents property and mom would bring us a huge bowl of pizza frit.
I recall this because Julie took me out to Lucile&amp;#8217;s for breakfast and they had pizza frit (they used a different name and powdered sugar instead of granulated but it was the same).</description>

      <description>The Pink Elephant pj&amp;#8217;s are for you Amy, since you liked the footie pajamas. I am not much of a fasionista, but, little girl clothes and shoes are pretty darn cute. So much so that I would even say its fun getting Hannah dressed in the morning. More fun than dressing myself since most days I could care less what I put on. When I dress Hannah, I actually think about stuff like matching and what she would like depending on the weather.</description>

      <description>Hannah strongly did not want me to get her dressed or brush her teeth this morning. She had to do it herself.
She also wanted Mammas muffin but could not have it. When she started complaining mamma used a bit if sarcasm in her voice when she told Hannah how mean we are. Do todlers understand sarcasm? Or did she just know that we were talking about her?</description>

      <description>Hannah signed &amp;#8216;horse&amp;#8217; for me the other day. The only thing is she thinks all harses are called &amp;#8216;BoBo&amp;#8217;.
Other stuff: got the lights taken down and the truck running today. It&amp;#8217;s prolly not the fuel pump. Maybe the cold start sensor? I&amp;#8217;ll need to do some more googling to see what the internets say.
Other things to do: finish the script to grep out five images from the blog images.</description>

      <description>It is almost Thanksgiving and as I start to reflect on all of the things I have to be thankful for, I cannot forget this one. Were it not for my Dad&amp;#8217;s many years of hard work and dedication to his family I would not be where I am today.
I can&amp;#8217;t say it in enough way&amp;#8217;s and sometimes the simplest way is the best, &amp;#8220;Thanks Dad, for everything!&amp;#8221; Congratulations and I hope you enjoy your retirement, you have earned it.</description>

      <description>Observing my daughters play behavior, it looks to me like the energy of a toddler is intoxicating.
She just goes and goes with an intense focused concentration. Thats prolly why she learns so much so fast.</description>
