I was laying a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. My constraints were:

&#8211; grid like structure
  
&#8211; on a cork board medium
  
&#8211; one center of focus
  
&#8211; even (ish) distribution
  
&#8211; minimum effort today

Physically doing the layout made me wish I had css3 or iOS auto layout to assist and tweak. It only took four tries ( including previous prototypes ) with some help from my two trusty assistants to get it the way I wanted it.

It&#8217;s a good start:

Finished and hung:
