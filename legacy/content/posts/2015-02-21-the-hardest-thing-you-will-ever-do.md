Just sit still.

Nothing else. No thought. No feeling. No movement. Well you must breath.

Ok. Start with 29 seconds. Why 29? Episode 29 was a cool thing to see when I was a freshman in high school. But that&#8217;s not why 29 seconds. <!--more-->

It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not quite 30 which is one half. And it&#8217;s way past 0. It adds up to eleven and then ends with the highest single digit integer that we know of. It makes perfect sense. Right?

Ok, that&#8217;s enough nostalgic trivia for you to walk back in time a bit for things that lead me to begin sitting still early in the morning and late at night. Depending on which side of the pillow I was.

Through the years, the best thing about having a hard time sleeping is the quiet. Quiet time, quiet sounds, still moments where anything can happen. The day either has not yet completed, leaving a bit of time for anything to happen. Or, its moments after staring anew and everything is on the horizon. You may also understand if you have ever ridden through the trees of a mountain glen while it&#8217;s snowing. Or stood amidst frozen trees on a moonlight night while the wind blows through the forest. That&#8217;s one is cool. Well cold and it may get a little creepy but there is something in that quiet that you can&#8217;t find anywhere else.

I haven&#8217;t finished my book. I&#8217;m an average engineer on my best days and I never landed a 720, back when I cared landing them and before my knee started talking to me.

I have learned to be happy. Getting a chance to do **The Hardest Thing You Will Ever Do** is the one thing that everyone gets. It&#8217;s the thing that will make the biggest difference, in the long run.

Just sit still.
