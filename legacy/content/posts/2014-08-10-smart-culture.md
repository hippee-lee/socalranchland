The intersection between computers and their intelligence connects the most complicated problems for a new intelligence.

Consider this:<!--more-->

Anyone with this in their playlist would find this:

If I ask you to play something, then bad spelling and all I want the song to play. I don&#8217;t care how it&#8217;s spelled. Momma and Mama are recognizable by a second grader. Computers will have to do this too. From the six year olds I talk to, I&#8217;m sure Momma would be reported to authority figures as mis-spelled . There you go. She is six. She is correct. And she is on her way to being very smart.

So clearly the two are the same thing. And the computer in my pocket connected to the most powerful networks ever still needs permission to search the internet for pop culture news related to a song Mama Sed. Anyone who knows me, like it hope my personal AI would should be able to find the song I mean.
