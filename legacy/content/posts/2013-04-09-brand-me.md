I started putting thought online and figured that was it. It would be easy to make it look good and easy to write well. Double ha on both of those. The writing is slightly easier (when I do it regularly) if I write, rewrite and then rewrite it two more times. It helps to regularly read E.B White and Strunk&#8217;s &#8216;The Elements of Style.&#8217; 

The look and feel of the site is harder, sure there are free and paid themes for WordPress but tweaking them only gets you so far. Once you want to really reflect individual personality you end up really designing your own styles on top of a good start. 

Today, I am putting a brand? logo? That has been rolling around inside for a while. I have tied several versions and this is just the latest but it is closer to what I see inside than anything else that has come out so far.
