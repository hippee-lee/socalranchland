I rode to work yesterday. Total ride time was 2:22. Total distance was ~37 miles. If I worked in the loop near Vista Ridge I should be able to make it more than 50 miles. Felt pretty good, I averaged a bit better than 15mph. Will need many more of these before the silverton 50.

We got up early this am and took Hannah to the balloon launch at the VR clubhouse. It is going to be a really nice weekend. Dave and Joan are visiting Hannah for the first time and we are going to take them to the Erie town fair today.
