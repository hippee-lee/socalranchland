I traveled with Julie and Hannah to the Conejo Valley, she had training for work. Hannah and I hung out with Grandma Cheryle Today. I got a very good nap when Hannah took hers this afternoon, almost two hours. More of the same, I want to ride Sycamore but I have a couple of other things that I want to get done on the computer first so I may just go over there and get a quick trail run in. I have been running alot lately even though I profess to dislike it. I think that is because it is quick, out the door type exercise and convenient. I think I am going to take one of the rock climbing classes at the rec center this winter. Its been years since my harness has been used and I forget the knots and other stuff thats important.

The weather here is really great. It was sunny and 85 today. It was overcast on Wednesday back in Erie but has cleared up even though fall weather has asserted itself in the last few days. Temperatures are only getting to the mid 50&#8217;s or low 60&#8217;s during the day and at night its getting below<!--more--> freezing. I noticed Gurgi and Whitney&#8217;s water bowl had frozen last week.

I had to get some stuff for Hannah so she got her First Trader Joe&#8217;s experience. Here is a pic.
