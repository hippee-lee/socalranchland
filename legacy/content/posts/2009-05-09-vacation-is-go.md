Vacation week is underway and Hannah is running a fever. This afternoon, she got all snuggly, and then her temp spiked to 104 for a few minutes. 10 long minutes later it was 102 and ten after that it was 100. Forty five minutes later it was normal, mama was home and Hannah was turning around yellng in that todler half speak that she makes up. 

I&#8217;m sure traveling will be interesting. We&#8217;ll see how the Elmo videos on my phone work out. ðŸ™‚
