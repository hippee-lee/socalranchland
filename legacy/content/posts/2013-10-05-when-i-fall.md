I do not base the measurement of myself on the number of times that I have fallen. I measure myself on two things: what was I doing when I fell and how did I get up.

If I&#8217;m not doing something that pushes my limits when I fall it&#8217;s time to make a change. Likewise, if I&#8217;m not motivated to get up and try again with knowledge gained, its time to make a change.
