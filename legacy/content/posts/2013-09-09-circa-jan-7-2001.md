A post from a notebook that I kept :

&nbsp;

There is no such thing as comfortable.

Success is:

  * Self contained
  * Focus
  * Conviction
  * Hardcore with a twist of funk
  * Handstands
  * Trust no one &#8211; Hey, why should I? Trust is earned.
  * Not being a scapegoat. Ever. For yourself, your failures or someone else&#8217;s.

I&#8217;m not sure what I was thinking back then but I was listening to a lot of [Mushroomhead](http://www.mushroomhead.com/main/) (Carefule here unless you still really like metal, I stopped following them so close around 2004) and [Unified Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Popson#Unified_Culture) at the time. On one of the Mushroomhead albums they had a quote from [Arthur Rimbaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud)

> I alone posses the key of this wild pageant.
