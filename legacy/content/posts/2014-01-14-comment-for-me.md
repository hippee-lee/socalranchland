I found myself replying to a conversation thread online and thought it was worth saving. 

> Do you plan on having children? Will your grandchildren&#8217;s grandchildren wonder where they came frome and what it was like?
> 
> If only I could query the daily activities and conversations of my great grandparents or query thousands of photos and movies for people, places and moments that my have been talked about when I was a child. I could understand my family better. Educate my daughter more fully and with better context other than telling her: well part of your family comes from the abruzzi region in Italy and another part comes from Germany, I think. And your mother, I don&#8217;t know much about her grandparents let alone, her great grandparents.

> It&#8217;s not always about us, or right now, that is important in the scope of life across generations. We don&#8217;t always know which of the ephemeral things in daily life are worth passing on to the next generation. Sometime they ( the next or several generations on down the line ) identify or rediscover our best moments long after we are gone.
