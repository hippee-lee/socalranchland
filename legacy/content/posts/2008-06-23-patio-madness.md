I have had a hard time getting back to making regular posts since Vegas. I have also had a hard time getting in my training rides for the 50 mile MTB race coming up. I want to at least be able to finish it in under 7.5 hours.

Hannah is growing so fast now. All she wants to do is stand up. You can put her between the couch and the ottoman and she bounces back and forth moving all around until she plops down. It is good that Marie is teaching her to plop. It saves her bopping her head on the floor.

Got about 75% of the patio installed last weekend. Julies parents were out and she helped me move alot of the materials. It would be so much easier if we could get the materials dropped off in the back yard. Rough totals: 22 tons of rock and road base and about 7000 pounds of wall block. It looks good. The pavers will be dropped off tonight and i&#8217;ll just slowly move them back there this week. I would not have been able to move the road base on Saturday without help from Cory and Dans.
