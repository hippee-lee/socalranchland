I sometimes use my site as a file transfer mechanism. It&#8217;s easier or email services do silly things and make it hard to transfer files in an easy way. I don&#8217;t use dropbox and googles drive is more cumbersome than $scp filename.zip to my hose. With my ssh keys in place its trivial to put the file where I need it to go.

I schedule an automated backup script to backup my site and its databases every month. It also does some clean up for me. Yesterday when I reviewed its report I noticed that this months backup was 4x larger than the month before. Weird I thought but wondered if I had put the video up there instead of up to youtube. Then I realized a couple of months ago I had put a large archive or photos on there to share with some folks. I had never deleted it. SInce I was already there poking around it was trial to rm the-large-file.zp.

I love, love, love the command line. It just makes it so easy to do things that should be simple to do. Now that I know enough to use muscle memory and have pre-paid the thought that goes into the learning how to do basic things, I don&#8217;t have to think about it. I just write the text that will do what I want.

I hope I can teach that to Hannah &#8211; the power is learning to use tools is cumulative and exponential &#8211; just like starting to save for retirement when you are in your early twenties instead of later on! Do a little bit now, chip away at it everyday and reap huge benefits in the coming years.

Happy Friday.
