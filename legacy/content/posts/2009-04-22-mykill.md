I find mysefl running ps -ef | grep WORD (usually Safari but sometimes other things) alot. The Safari 4 beta is nice but still has some issues and it keeps locking up on me when I forget and use Conkerors navigation commands. Maybe I should just force myself to spend more time in Conkeror since its more emacs friendly. Not wanting to continue typing the same thing over and over again I wrote this:

> #filter ps -ef output by argument and
  
> #show user pid&#8217;s and process application name
  
> #give option to kill a pid

To run it:

$mykill &#8220;search terms&#8217;
