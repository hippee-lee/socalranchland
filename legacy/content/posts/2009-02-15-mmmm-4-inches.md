Rode up at Winterpark today with Jean-Francois. He rode to, no tellys for him today. 

We started off in the fresh pow of Eagle Wind until they stopped blasting the Vasquez Circque. The mile+ hike is totally worth it. I haven&#8217;t been on steeps like that since the Mammoth days and this was way less tracked because of the hiking required.
  
On the way home, he said we had to stop in Idaho Springs and get something called a &#8216;mountain pie.&#8217; the place, Beau Joes (sp?) could possibly be the best pizza ever! It comes with huge crust that you save for last and then put honey on it. Yum nummy. 

Julie and Hannah are in Cali for a few more days; I enjoy the quiet around the house but there is also something missing.
