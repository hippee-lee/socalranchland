A minor rant on the inability of large companies to meet my needs. I understand that they do everything for the average customer and that really means the numbers that the MBA&#8217;s and finance geeks tell them are important. There is no real person who is the average home depot customer and that means the individuals get passed over in the end. Thats fine, I understand that they have to keep the shareholdes happy.

I just don&#8217;t want them to pretend that &#8220;they can help&#8221; or that they &#8220;are the experts.&#8221; If, like earlier in the summer I needed something cut and you can&#8217;t cut it or like today when you can&#8217;t maintain your rental equipment (paver cutting wet saw) so that it is available when I need it ( they rental guy said it&#8217;s been over a month and there it&#8217;s not looking good for the future) then how can I trusty your advertising and your nice folks who want to help me? 

I don&#8217;t think I can trust Home Depot and they certainly could not help 🙁

Perhaps there is a rental place in Lafayette that will be able to help me.
