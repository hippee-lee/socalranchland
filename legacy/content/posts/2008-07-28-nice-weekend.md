We had a great weekend, even though we missed Julie. While she was off in Cancun relaxing Hannah spent the weekend with my parents showing them her tricks: waving, standing and taking baby steps. When she wants something she is willing to let go of her support and take a step or two towards the object of her desire.
  
We got the bricks returned and the yard work done and even got Hannah some new sandals for the summertime. Even with my parents here, it is hard to take care of Hannah by myself. THe longer Julie was gone I noticed more little things that she did which are easy to take fro granted. I was glad to pick her up last night.

Oh yes, Dad got the truck running again, apparently when I changed the plugs and wires I crossed cylinders 1 and 8). Dodge has a strange firing order on the &#8217;97 Dakota.

Things to do this week before we leave for San Diego:

  * fix the electrical (Measure the diameter of the pvc pipe)
  * reset the middle sprinkler range at the top of the backyard
  * <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reset the bricks where the ants dug sand up</span>
  * <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reset the bricks around the edge where it has settled a quarter<!--more--> inch or so</span>

  * <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">go out and see Mr Bo at least twice.</span>

  If I can get all of that done it would be great. We will see.
