Since setting up at the new shop I have seen several issues with the legacy codebase that I am working with.
  
The biggest thing that throws emacs off is the inconsistency&#8217;s that tabs cause in various parts of the code. some places have no tabs others are all tabs for indentation. Since I don&#8217;t really care one way or the other I finally googled &#8216;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=emacs+%2B+tabs&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a" target="_self">emacs + tabs</a>&#8216; and learned about tabify/untabify. This looks prommising since I can easily go one way or the other depending on what is in the region I need to work with.
