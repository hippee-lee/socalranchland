That seems to be all mobile safari can do. I cannot read the news withhout it crashing several times. Does Apple have to many projects to support good quality control? 

I am looking forward to the android competition in the marketplace. And will strongly consider one of their offerings next, before buying a second iphone. 

It is possible to remove the iTunes drm, so that&#8217;s not a show stopper, the app store still seems buggy and has not impressed me much. 

I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ll see, but my next laptop might not be a mac either. That means Julie will have to learn Linux. That would be her third new OS in under ten years. Good thing she is smart and adaptable.
