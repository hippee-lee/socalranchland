I read about someone who decides the day before what The Most Important Thing is for the next day. Then, as part of their routine they spend an uninterrupted 90 minutes working on that Thing. Sounds like a good idea. I am a create of habit and routine &#8211; I like the balance it provides.

Julie and Hannah are heading up to McMinnville next week during Amgen&#8217;s summer shutdown for a week off. I&#8217;m not sure but I think I might be the one getting a week off ðŸ™‚ Shhhhhh.

So to pseudo plan my solo week routine I have a list of the most Important Things that will need my attention:

  1. Daily walks or rides around with the dogs.
  2. Ride -> WP&#8217;s bike park is open and the new Valmont bike park needs to be scouted out for fun and to plan future trips with Hannah and perhaps Julie.
  3. Climb. It&#8217;s much more fun than lifting weights.
  4. Build The Wall. I think the arc needs to go around to the fence post and then I can step down 3.5 or 4 steps.
  5. <del>Stain Pergola. Didn&#8217;t get to last fall or spring &#8230; </del>
  6. Bug AMEX about the claim.

Two of the Important Things are really just routines that<!--more--> I used to have when there was more time for Me. Two others are worthwhile yard projects and Climbing is fun and good for me. That&#8217;s why I think I am the one getting the week off even though it is still a usual work week. For riding and exploring VBP it will be easy to get up early and maybe even hit it twice. The dogs will fit in nicely at either 6ish or later after Climbing. I&#8217;ll continue chipping away at the wall, I&#8217;m thinking sunday afternoon and Wednesday will be the main days with time build into Friday. Sunday morning i&#8217;ll get up to WP for a while and then head up to Fort Collins to explore that trail on Monday. The staining will happen on Saturday after I get back from the airport.

Mmmm Costa Rican Coffee.
