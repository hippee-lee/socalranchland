After we got back from the outlets, Hannah helped me fix her leopard skin chair. Enjoy the movie.


  
Then we were putting Bella&#8217;s cat house in the garage. I told Hannah that bella was still missing, it was the first time she really asked much about her since she didn&#8217;t come home for dinner. Then Hannah said, &#8220;Bella work?&#8221; Going to work=missing cat? hmmmm, but I can get that.<figure id="attachment_1217" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

She says &#8216;Moma work&#8217; when you are already gone for work during the week. And she followed &#8216;Bella work&#8217; with &#8216;Momma work.&#8217; so I asked her if she missed you. she heartily said &#8216;YES!&#8217;. I have also been telling her you are on a ship. She likes ships.

After tidying up a bit and some more fun with crayons I got an Elmo request. I gave her &#8216;Elmo in Grouchland&#8217; and noticed something. She knows when to laugh sometimes and participated a bit when the movie started. Oh yes, i forgot to tell you, she fell asleep last night to Star Wars episode I. She only lasted about 30 minutes or so but she had lots of &#8216;Whats dis?&#8217; and &#8216;Whats dat?&#8217;<figure id="attachment_1215" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I think she misses you, but is rolling with it and having fun.
