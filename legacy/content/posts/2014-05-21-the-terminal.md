I&#8217;ll forget it when your app does the same things, in the same way and is as easily customizable as the command line. <!--more--> Pictures and other shiny guy things are optional. But, the exact same functionality must be there. Not almost the same. The same. Oh yeah, an emacs like influence would be a good thing too.

Oh wait. Were you just talking about the git cli? I was talking about everything else that lives there too. Hmm, since I want to stay at my current productivity level, I&#8217;ll remember the terminal for now.
