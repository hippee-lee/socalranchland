&nbsp;

Hannah is not quite reading the Dr. Seuss book, &#8220;Hop On Pop.&#8221; Despite the drama that seems to have become part of the night night routine, I really like reading books with her. She has me point to the words and read them and then she copies me. She gets impatient when there are more than one sentence and uses the pictures as context and reads ahead.

It&#8217;s an odd juxtaposition of her partial knowledge of words and reading and her ability to use context to figure out the words on the page. I know I used to do this alot when I read books with words or ideas that I am not familiar with. The incremental way we learn new things seems to repeat no matter what level you are on.
