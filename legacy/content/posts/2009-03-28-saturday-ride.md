Nice day, good weather. I got two nice drops into Vasquez Cirque. It was a little bumpy but there were still some calf/knee high patches and some decent turns leading into them. I need to think about dropping in less, unless I plan on going down one of the rocky chutes, I noticed that my turns feel more natural when I am reacting to the conditions of THIS turn rather than thinking about the next turn or the last turn or the really big rock that is coming up fast.Ã‚Â VisualizationÃ‚Â is still good at the top, it gives me a game plan but plans don&#8217;t always turn out as you would expect.

Got two runs down the baby park, popped some nice mellow airs on the baby five footers and the little rails and boxes are always fun. The biggest surprise was the carving and turns on my way back to winter park parking lot. I leaned into some gorgous s-turns and got really good extension both toe side and heel side. There was a bit of corn on the way down too, spring is fast approaching (the last week of weather aside). The last three weekends should be great for<!--more--> park and carving. Not so sure about Vasquez though, hopefully it will grow lots of corn in the mid morning. We&#8217;ll see.

I have been on a huge Nine Inch Nails kick lately. I really like the last album, The Slip, Ã‚Â and the Ghost (I-IV) albums. However I am chilling to some Morcheeba on my drive home.
