Had a cold wet ride in to Boulder. It was about 40 degree when I left Erie and not raining. By the time I got to Lafayette it had started raining and by the time I came into Boulder it was snowing. I wish my truck was running today.

We Just got back from four days in San Francisco and I found out how hard it is to work and watch Hannah. I think she is getting bored pretty easily now. I noticed that she is happy entertaining herself for a little while, maybe half an hour. Then she wants some attention or different stimulation. In the mornign she would have her naps and play sessions and I could get some stuff done but then she would get fussy. By the time I went out to meet Julie for lunch she would be a bit cranky. Then I would put on the Bjorn and one of her hats (tangent: i got her a really cute reversible green and white / light green and pink flowers hat that straps on below her chin) and out we would go. As soon as we got into the elevator she would start smiling at anyone near<!--more--> and then when we got outside she would go into a focused hyper alert mode. I think she was seeing everything and trying to make sense of all the crazyness.

I need to fix the truck. Hopefully it just needs new plugs and a new wiring harness.
