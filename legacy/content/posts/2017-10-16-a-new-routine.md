I need to establish a new routine that lets me make progress on my personal goals.&nbsp;

Every week I need to review and document myself.&nbsp;

First, I need to commit to those nebulous goals that roll around in my head. The things I’ll do someday and the ideas that I can visualize with a hazy lack of clarity but keep floating to the surface.&nbsp;

From the Principles book:

  1. Have clear goals.
  2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.
  3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.
  4. Design plans that will get you around them.
  5. Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results.

Two things that come to mind as I sit here writing this are the MALU:silent-guild book and the Pathmates app.&nbsp;

I have eight years before I turn 50. Surely that’s enough time to visualize, create and breath life into both projects.&nbsp;
