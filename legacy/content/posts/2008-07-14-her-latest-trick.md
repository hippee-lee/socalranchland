Hannahs MOST FUN THING TO DO, lately, has been to pull herself up on something and then let go. She flaps her arms like a bird and tries to balance on two legs. The longest she can balance is for 10 &#8211; 15 seconds. She is also starting to look at other objects that she can balance on and edge her self close to them. I can see her thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I can run to that before I fall!&#8221; A little birdie is telling me that she will be walking before to long.

She is also started saying &#8220;OH!&#8221;

Sometimes it is after we tell her &#8220;NO!&#8221;

Its kinda funny. We are still workign on some basic signs with her: Eat, More, No, gentle Mamma and Pappa. Nothing back yet but I think she might be starting to get the communicaiton thing. She is sleeping well. What is working now is that she will go down with Julie around 8:30 &#8211; 9:00 and then I&#8217;ll take her into her crib when I come to bed, later. For the last few days she has been sleeping through the night until about 5:45am or so.

I logged about 120 miles last week, mostly on the AM<!--more--> Train. I did 16 miles at winter park and had to walk some of the Icarus Trail &#8211; the rear drive train was acting funny so I didn&#8217;t want to mess up the chain. I did get some good climbing at altitude in though SHould be ready for next Saturday. Remember your goal: 25 miles in 3.5 hours.
