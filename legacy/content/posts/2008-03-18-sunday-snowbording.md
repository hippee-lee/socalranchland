I went up to eldora on Sunday afternoon with Cory. First couple of runs were ok, but then it started to get fun. When you are in the trees and it starts to snow it is the most magical time. Even better than moonrise/moonset.
  
We made our way to the west side, Corona, and tried a few tree runs. All the way over, riders left, seemed a little rutty so we tried the trees just after the path gets going and they were alot of fun. It snowed a couple inches while we rode and there was no wind.
  
I&#8217;m not sure why, but they roped them off around 3:00pm. Best ride of this year so far, but that&#8217;s not saying much since I haven&#8217;t gotten up to Berthoud or Mary Jane either.
