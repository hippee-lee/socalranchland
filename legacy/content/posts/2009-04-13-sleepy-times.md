You have been fighting an infection since late last week. On Sunday you hardly wanted to play. Just cuddle with momma and take naps all day.

The night before last you woke up at midnight. You settled into the chair next to my side and we read one of your books. The encyclopedia one. Then I read to you from a book I was reading, Heart in Atlantis by Steven King. I have read it before but I like the story. In about a half an hour you were sound asleep and I tucked you in and kissed you goodnight.

Tonight when I moved you into you own bed you fussed a little bit so I rocked you like I did when you were little. You fell asleep on my shoulder and it was the best part of my day; next to eating yummy Julie cake fresh from the oven. Then when I thought you were asleep I moved you into the crib. You weren&#8217;t asleep. I got you to lay down and gently rubber your back in comfort. It&#8217;s been a while but I do remember what it&#8217;s like to have a fever. After a few minutes you got quite again and<!--more--> I kissed you night, night.

I think your momma took this picture of you and it looks like you are wearing your meal all over your face.
