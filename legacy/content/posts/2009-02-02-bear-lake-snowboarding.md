Had a great day at the RMNP Bear Lake trail system. The only things missing were Julie and Hannah, but I think they might of been a little cold. This picture is of me hiking up to get some turns. Given my limited back country experience it was the first time in a long time that my heart rate was already going even before I dropped in, and, I only hiked halfway up the slope pictured in this picture.Ã‚Â 

Conditions were considerable for steep slopes above the tree line (like pictured here), but moderate in most other places. I dug a pit and had good results with the pressure and shear tests, plus there were several skiers who went down this slope before me as well.
