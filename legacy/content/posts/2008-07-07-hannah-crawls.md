Hannah started crawling for real this past weekend. It will be soon that she is standing up and running from support object to support object. She is getting also getting very vocal and has started to not like to sleep through the night üôÅ

I did a training ride on Saturday, 25 miles on the colorado trail. I started from the Gold Hill Mine trailhead and went clockwise (if you are lookign east. It took just about 4 hours total time but only 3 hours and 20 minutes of actual ride time. I took several breaks and stopped to make sure I was still on the Colorado trail a few times. Going up, though I got winded several times on the switch backs and had to take a breather. 50 miles is going to be tough. I think I&#8217;ll be able to make the four hour cutoff though. Thats my goal&#8230;. just finish.
