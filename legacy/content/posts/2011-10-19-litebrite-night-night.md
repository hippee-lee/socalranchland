Tonight Hannah and I did LiteBrite instead of reading books for night nights. She sometimes does that &#8230; &#8216;Papa, can we play a game instead of read books tonight?&#8217;

Then, the drama classes kicked in and she got upset at me. I make deals with her. Tonight the deal was for her to wait in bed for me to come back with my guitar and play her a song after I went to brush my teeth and do shot shot. 

The little bunny did not stay in her bed and the deal was off. This was upsetting and I understand. I also understand that we don&#8217;t always get what we want. I think it&#8217;s my job as a parent to teach Hannah that but I&#8217;m not sure. They forgot the manual when were came home with her four years ago. I think that its not just teaching her that we don&#8217;t always get what we want but that when a decision has been made there isn&#8217;t much use crying over it. Has anyone ever been able to teach this to a four year old girl? I don&#8217;t know, me I&#8217;ll just keep chipping away at her subconscious. I know that I&#8217;ll be<!--more--> rolling around in there for a long time. I know this because I still here both of my parents from time to time. Or, as Roland would say &#8211; I remember the face of my father (and mother). 

Here are a few pictures of tonights artwork.
