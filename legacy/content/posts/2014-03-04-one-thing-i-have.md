There are other things. But tonight the camera in my pocket is worth priceless. When I was a kid and I helped do repair it was taking things apart to see what could be salvaged and putting them back together if there was a way or we could get the right parts to replace.<!--more-->

There was usually a final question related to extra nut, bolt, screw and what were those for? As I got older and graduated to oil changes and gas tank swap outs I really, really, really wish that I could have taken pictures before I started. One thing that I wish I knew back then was to take a snapshot at the crucial ( you know when they are ) phases. It would have been handy if the one thing I had back then was a camera in my pocket and the knowledge to use it. Sort of like version control for DIY stuff at home. Unlike version control in that I can only look back to a moment int time and can&#8217;t make a branch: $ git checkout disposal_repair is what I would call it.

So the pictures are a little bit like a map, more of a guide and a way to provide reference for how things once were. Tonight when I swap this, because it&#8217;s late and I have other things on my mind it&#8217;s pictures all the way baby.

It turns out there was no need but I can&#8217;t remember how many times I have said I wish I had taken a picture of that first. You never know.Â And the upgraded model doesn&#8217;t look 30 years old. Now, I can remember the serial number here when I inevitably lose the happy green save the world with this disposer manual.

Now I have a new disposer that doesn&#8217;t leak and that&#8217;s good too.
