I have always loved good music. I&#8217;ve heard some good songs of this time and I still love it when I come across timeless lyrics like this:

> Kick out the jams, kick up the soul
> 
> pour another glass of that rock and roll

I&#8217;m a long way from the mid 90&#8217;s Cleveland metal scene. &nbsp;Boy! Man o man did it train my ear to find the good sounds in the sonically oversaturated internet world of 2015.&nbsp;

I love my rock and roll because it can be soooo, so, so, so many things. It can be time less. Sometimes its the people and the moment that the movement requires. The moment seeded correctly, nurtured carefully and then grown into a movement that sticks around for a generation or two. And forever in some minds. &nbsp;

So kick out your jams. Pour your glass and rock and roll when you can. &nbsp;Some moments are only memorable because they happen for the first time once. Live it. Because, in that space there is room for your soul. Which I believe to be a collection of memories that are created in the first moments of new discovery and pursued anew again forever more. They last forever but are uniq. (Misspelled on purpose)
