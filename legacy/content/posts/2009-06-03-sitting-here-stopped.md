I miss riding my mountain bike to work. I am not talking about the crappy bike lane commute into boulder. I miss the ride from the Moorepark trailhead to Amgen in Thousand Oaks.

It took about 45 min, had showers when I got there and I usually had the trail to lonesome. 

Time is a luxury that I didn&#8217;t realize I had until I started to run out of it.
