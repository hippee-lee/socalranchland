Went for a training ride around Anthem and Vista Ridge this morning. Started out on a little loop. But ehen I came around by Bo&#8217;s stable I decided to keep going up to highway 52. Over to county line road and then back through Anthem turned my ride into a big loop. I did a second smaller loop for good measure and made it back home before ten am.Ã‚Â 

**Ride Stats**

Distance: 38.60 miles

Ride Time: 2:26.40

Average Speed: 15.78 mph

Max Speed: 35.80 mph

The max speed wasÃ‚Â achievedÃ‚Â on the second loop around Anthem. Coming up to the bridge that crosses E470. Another highlight was seeing the balloon launch again but from a more distant perspective. That park over by Sheridan Pkwy might be a good place to watch the Balloon launch next year if we want to miss the traffic and bring the dogs. We could bring a picnic breakfast. Hmmm.

Today around the house Hannah is helping momma fix up her railing boxesÃ‚Â withÃ‚Â perennials and we also got a tree, i think its vibram.
