While we were playing this morning Hannah wanted to wear my sunglasses. I told her she looked like a little spy. 

I think she is like her pappa in that she doesn&#8217;t like changes. They upset her internal balance mechanisms. When mamma and pappa go to work, it&#8217;s a big change in her enviornment so it has been really traumatic for her since Kat started to watch her instead of Marie. It breaks my heart to drive away and see her standing at the front door looking out at me and reaching out. If I didn&#8217;t know that she was happily playing and busy with her activities five minutes later I don&#8217;t think I would get any work done.
