So what, you think different. So does everyone else. If we all think different, all the time there will be billions of little revolutions that spark, flare up and flame out. The flare ups that evolve into consuming a fuel source are the ones that change everything. They transform the landscape as they go through their lifecycle. Everything has a lifecycle: businesses, ideas and organisms alike. &#8220;Whatever it is, we all go through it&#8221; &#8211; [Latyrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latyrx) (I think)

As businesses, they take decades or centuries to flame out. Because, they evolve to adapt and consume fuel efficiently instead of all at once. As ideas they have lasted thousands of years so far. The good ideas in our species seem to propagate from generation to generation and from location to location in poorly misunderstood ways that, while easily observable, are poorly understood. But they do survive and migrate. As they do the rough edges get worn down and the surface gets polished and then the idea gets passed along.

We need both. And we need to learn to recognize both in out thoughts. Most of our revolutionary thoughts are not for the real world. If we recognize the ones that are and can evolve them properly, together revolution & evolution change everything.
