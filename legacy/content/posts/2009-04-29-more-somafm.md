I just found out that SomaFM &#8211; Groove Salad is available for the iPhone and over Edge. IT&#8217;s getting addicting and I amy have to pony up some cash for them if I keep usingÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â bandwidth.

I also think that Groove Salad \*sounds\*different at night. I was doing homework after mid-night last night and the night before and there were some really cool remixes of songs I have heard before on there. Not so many during the day that I can identify.
