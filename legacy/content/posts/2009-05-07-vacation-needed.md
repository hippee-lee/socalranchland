She did great!</figcaption></figure> 

Going to school is hard, I forgot how much so from the last time. I guess I did it to myself, I could have turned the scholarship down, but then I wouldn&#8217;t have these interesting shell scripting word problems to solve. They make a pretty good puzzle. And this class only goes for a few more weeks. I have never been to a school that did ten week classes. 

This picture made me laugh. She is so happily industrious, it&#8217;s infectious.
