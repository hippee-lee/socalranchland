My tiny girl is growing bigger by the day. She is getting to big to fall asleep
  
In my lap at bedtime. Lately she has been tossing and turning when we sit In the rocking chair looking at the moon and stars on the ceiling.
  
Tonight was the first time she wouldn&#8217;t fall asleep for me. I had to put her in the crib so she could get comfy. Then her breathing slowed and her eyes closed and off she went to &#8216;seep seep&#8217; dreamtime land. That&#8217;s what I have been calling it. I wonder what a one year old dreams about.
  
Later when I put myself down for &#8216;seep seep&#8217; dreamtime, I found a little sock in bed and thought of the foot that goes inside it. It&#8217;s getting bigger by the day. As it gets to big to leave one kind of foot print in my mind, I find myself extremely excited to find out where her next footprint will take us.
