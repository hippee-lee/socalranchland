Julie told me this morning that Hannah signed &#8216;more&#8217; to Marie yesterday. When Marie feeds her lunch she says &#8220;More&#8221; but usually doesn&#8217;t sign it. Hannah gave her the sign when she said it.

This morning when I was holding Hannah she gave me a big, sloppy open mouthed wet kiss instead of turning away and giggling like she usually does. That made my doy no matter what happens.

Boxers at work again today, yay. I should have the fence built by the end of this weekend.

The picture is of a very excited Hannah (in low light, hence the blurring) looking through a magazine.
