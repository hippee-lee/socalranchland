&nbsp;

Hannah brought home some art yesterday that reminded me of my 3rd and 5th grade teacher. Her name was Mrs. Sweet. She introduced me to the Fantasy genre of reading &#8211; Eddings, Brooks etc. Later, when I had her again in 5th grade she pushed me towards Asimov. I am eternally grateful for the hours of content reading that has followed through the years.

In both 3rd and 5th grade there was a Creative Writing time. I forget if it was daily &#8211; but we did it enough that it stuck in my memory. She would write a phrase on the blackboard, something like:

### **<span style="color: #333333;">When a dragon came to town &#8230;</span>**

Our assignment was to complete that sentence and keep writing. I can&#8217;t remember much of what I wrote or even if I was very good at it &#8211; I had a hard time sitting still in school. I do remember that I enjoyed that time because, in her words, &#8220;There is no wrong answer, just keep writing.&#8221;

### In the spirit of that memory Hannah says:
  
**<span style="color: #333333;">She took my house and the dragon ate some of my food.</span>**

Moving the story forward, I say:

**<span style="color: #333333;">The dragon was full and she lay down<!--more--> under the Autumn Blaze Maple tree in the backyard. Next to the hole in the ground where the house used to be, she fell asleep until Hannah came riding home on her horse, BoBo. Loping next to her were Hannah&#8217;s two fierce Boxer dogs and loyal cat KeeKee.</span>**


  
** <span style="color: #333333;">They saw what the dragon had done and prepared to do battle.</span>**
  
** <span style="color: #333333;">The dragon woke up and got scared. She asked Hannah, &#8220;Whats wrong?&#8221;</span>**
  
** <span style="color: #333333;">Hannah answered, &#8220;You took my house and ate my food &#8211; That makes me cranky because I don&#8217;t have a place to eat lunch or take an afternoon nap.&#8221;</span>**
  
** <span style="color: #333333;">The dragon understood and gave back the house. Then she told Hannah to climb on her back and she flew her to Marco&#8217;s Pizza at the Orchard Town Center and they both got slices of cheese pizza. The End. </span>**
