I&#8217;ve been using [Procreate](http://procreate.si) more and more. It is steadily replacing [Paper by 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) as my go to app to sketch, mock or doodle. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the weird tone the support staff takes in papers forums (and the sad we&#8217;re just like Apple and we know what&#8217;s best for you attitude; without even knowing why Apple can get away with it and they can&#8217;t) or the Pro part of Procreate: a free downloadable book for the manual, layers and I can import things into the app to draw on top of. Not to mention the excellent drawing tools.

Anyway, since moving hosts I&#8217;ve been thinking about new front page ideas, from graphics to functionality. This is a doodle I did in the mall while H and I were waiting in the Apple store.

Keywords: search, see, read (Matt) each have different behaviors.
  
Snippits: pull out different three to seven word phrases, at random\* and get them onto the screen as a link to the rest. \*not really random but an approximation.
