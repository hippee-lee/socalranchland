I was feeding Hannah breakfast this morning and she showed me the sign for more! She really enjoyed herÃ‚Â bananaÃ‚Â and oatmeal cereal with yogurt. Almost every time I asked her, &#8220;More eat?&#8221; she did the more sign. It was really cool to see my little girlÃ‚Â communicatingÃ‚Â with me on her own level and I look forward to many more interesting conversations with her. I am especially interested in her world view as she grows and her experiences take her into the wide, wide world.Ã‚Â 

It&#8217;s getting cold at night now, last night it got down to the upper 40&#8217;s. Fall is just around the corner along with Hannah&#8217;s one year birthday.
