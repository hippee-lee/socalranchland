  Life is a cycle and this is something I used to say to Hannah when she let me walk her into the schoolyard. The sketch was an idea I jotted down about how to visualize life in a personal context.

  We start our cycles and learn whats fun and not fun. We learn how to work so that some things are more fun. We try to achieve a dream. We fail. If we are lucky we learn from the failures and keep dreaming. Once day we we find ourselves wishing something for someone else and hoping that they understand how to get there. We try to help then because its fun and we learn that when you teach, you are still a student.

  The path we chose to walk follows cycles and everyone should be so lucky to find good people that they can say something like &#8220;Hugs, kisses & I love you too!&#8221;
