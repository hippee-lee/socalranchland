This is a variation on the &#8216;play with me&#8217; or &#8216;what should we do?&#8217; or &#8216;what game can we play?&#8217; questions that I get asked with regularity.

Being a parent has meant that I learned to just let go of what I want to do and go with the flow most of the time. It&#8217;s more fun, leads me on unexpected paths not normal to my routine and sometime, sometimes it takes me back to places I have not visited since I was a child. 

There is great power and energy in being child like. There is also a huge amount of entropy and randomness. Recognizing that helps me focus as a parent in guiding her to focus on something while doing childish things. 

Today we drew pictures. Me &#8216;guy with hat&#8217; and H &#8216;cube&#8217; &#8211; she told me it&#8217;s her favorite shape right now.
