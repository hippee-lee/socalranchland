It was a strange feeling to go over the M&S&#8217;s last night with Julie gone and my√É‚Äö√Ç parents√É‚Äö√Ç watching Hannah. Hannah did great last night. We√É‚Äö√Ç went√É‚Äö√Ç through her usual routine of playing, eating, and shower. Since it was only 6:30 Papa Rosa and I went to the auto part store to get a new distributer cap and√É‚Äö√Ç rotor√É‚Äö√Ç thingy. Hannah came with us and took a light nap on the way there. The auto store woke her up though and she stayed awake until we got home. She wasn&#8217;t quite all the way tired so Mom played with her till she put her to bed. She stayed down all night! It was reported to me yesterday that she can stand on her own and take three or four steps at a time all by herself. I&#8217;ll have to get a video of that. I can maybe post it on the website.

Hannah woke up this morning is a very smiley mood. She drank her bottle in less than ten minutes and then started crawling all over me and looking at the animals. We got up and went downstairs to get breakfast ready and Momma Rosa made Papa Rosa feed Hannah. She<!--more--> wants Hannah to get more comfortable with him. Apparently Hannah does to my Dad the same thing she does to me when Julie is around. If Mom comes into the room and Dad and Hannah are playing, Hannah gets upset and wants Mom to come over to her and pay attention. Sound familiar? üôÇ We are going to go to the Concert in the Park tonight and I will try to post some pictures on the webpage for you by√É‚Äö√Ç tomorrow√É‚Äö√Ç morning. Depending on how things go tonight I might try to go see the new X-Files movie at one of the later showings. Everyone at work raves about the Dark NIght so we shall have to find some time to go see that when you get back.

I started to read GEB last night before I went to sleep. The intro is very interesting and it reminds me alot of the Seven Mysteries Of Life book from the 60&#8217;s. It&#8217;s long but it√É‚Äö√Ç should√É‚Äö√Ç be a good read.
