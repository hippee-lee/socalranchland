### Get Past The First One

Get past the first Protoype as fast as you can. It&#8217;s not going to be perfect but, it should solve your problem and give you a handle on the problem space. This is just the painful birthing process where your idea leaves the mind and enters the world.<!--more-->

When I started, I would often I stop just after this. If it was code that was born,  I would clean up a bit, add some tests to sanity check my assumptions and write a pithy commit linked to the ticket for that story. Some of this is practicality: the real world doesn&#8217;t pay for perfection. But it does pay for functionality at first. When the  perfection is useful, minimal and almost imperceptible it is then that some folks notice. Most never do notice but they will say things like, &#8220;You know I really like that widget but I can&#8217;t put my finger on why.&#8221; Others go about their day without any interruption and never see the widget (until it breaks).

### Todays Prototype

I seem to be more observant of both space and light in my home and I am less willing to put up with actors in there who offend me with lack of good use. Having a bit of time on my hands I got annoyed by the lack of space in an old pantry in my house and I made a prototype that gives me more space. For $20 in hardware and wood I get a slide out shelf that I can use as a template for some future spaces that are ripe for optimization.

#### My constraints were

  1. No more than a day
  2. No large scale remodeling (use existing structure
  3. It has to cost less than one of the single shelf kits available for order on the internet
  4. I have to be able to reuse the concept in other places around the house

I know it looks simple Rather than explain how annoyed I get when I have to reach into the back of that space, I&#8217;ll just show the after prototype images.
