### Letting go is the hardest parental job to do.

Last year we stopped using the ski reigns on Hannah while going down the slopes. The snowboard line is very different from the skiers line &#8211; especially at slow speeds. IT got to be a lot of work but I still didn&#8217;t want to let go. Finally, on a jbar hill with mama in back I just had her follow me. It worked, she figured out how to turn and stop and all the things I was scared of, well they are still there. She tells me she wants to go faster now.

Same thing yesterday at the park. I know that there will be some bonks and bangs learning to ride without training wheels. THe hardest thing to do isn&#8217;t something she can do for herself. I have to let go and trust that she will find a way to keep her balance as long as she keeps moving forward.
