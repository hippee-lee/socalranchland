In life, everything evolves. Not quite the same as the Darwinian definition of the word but its a close metaphor. But, in the small, learning and adapting behavior to take advantage of knowledge sense of the word. That&#8217;s why animals, people included, migrate. Birds go where it&#8217;s warmer and the food is easy. People migrate around various web properties because they find value for their time there. Then a new shiny service starts up and they migrate again.<!--more-->

It has been my goal to migrate my site away from shared hosting for a while now. At any given time I have 10+ vhosts on my various development computers. So in real life it is frustrating to need to escape the shared hosting handcuffs when I want to do something outside of a web, one click install thingy. Also, not being able to apt-get blah so I can try something out is annoying.

Justifying the cost to my CFO, however, was never viable at the costs when I priced my options. Enter the new cool kid on the block: DigitalOcean. For $5 a month they give me everything I need to run my site in my own virtual server. It&#8217;s even less than the old shared hosting account I migrated away from. Yes, this is the first post to my new setup.

Things left to do:

  * Confirm that the DNS has propagated
  * Cancel Bluehost account
  * Migrate and modify the site&#8217;s back up script to the new host
  * Go for a ride
