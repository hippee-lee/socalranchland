Today was the Seventh time I picked out pumpkins with Julie and Hannah. Years gone by and I only blinked my eye. <!--more-->The rock climbing was &#8230; interesting and less about the rocks than I thought it would be. A party preceded by soccer and followed with a visit to the pumpkin patch; it looked like a pretty good day. Never can tell for sure anymore. Even for the experts, the weather is difficult to predict. I just make it up as I go along.

Tomorrow is papa/daughter day at Disney and tonight she was asleep before 7:30. I love it when a plan comes together. Oh yeah, I am happy to report that the bug vacuum was already put to good use protecting both Julie and Hannah from those scary spiders.
