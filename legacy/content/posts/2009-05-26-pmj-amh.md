Had a seriously good time last night with Julie at the ninja show. There was a 1/4 moon setting in the western sky, an 800 fill sleeping bag to keep us warm and rock show loud enough to make the ground vibrate. Head Like A Hole always jams, hard.

This morning I had a seriously good time with Hannah. She was very determined to get herself dressed. Very entertaining. She did get her shoes on, but I helped a little. The hat was all her.

No pics really came out from last night but I got some of Hannah looking very stylish this morning.
