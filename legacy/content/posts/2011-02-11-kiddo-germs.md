Hannah is running a fever again. On the one hand I know her immune system is getting stronger and more prepared to fight the future. On the other hand I was looking forward to taking her skiing tomorrow While everyone else snowboards.

I hope a good night of child sleep is just the thing she needs to bounce back.

Here are some pictures of me her last weekend. We found a hill close to home and went sledding, made snow sculpture and snow angels.
