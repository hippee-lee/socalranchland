Internet radio is so very convienient. Not having cable I can&#8217;t watch the Cavs stay alive on TV. Since they don&#8217;t offer me the opportunity to pay to watch on NBA.com, at least not that was easy to find, I fired up iTunes and there it is under the sports/talk internet radio section.

It reminds me of visiting my Grandpa I when I was little. He used to sit under he awning and listen to Indians games on a little portable am/fm radio while playing solitaire in the afternoon.

Go Cavs!
