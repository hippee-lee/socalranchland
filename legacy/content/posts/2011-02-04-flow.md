As I work through the additions I realized what bothers me about the cms. It gets in the way of my flow. I can&#8217;t just do a bunch of things and then save them. I have to do one thing, wait for the blocking ajax call. I thought the point of ajax was to let the user do other stuff while the service worked in the background.

The system should be able to track where the user was and be able to quickly, )one click) get them back there.

You could not ride a snowboard like this. Well you could, and people do but they usually end up tired, sore and banged up at the end of the day. Finishing, is like snowboarding. You are better off if you can keep moving forward (or backward if you ride switch) and the faster you go the more balance you have. The more balance you have the less you fall.

Your core is key. Strong fundamentals can go a long way towards minimizing your pain along the way.
