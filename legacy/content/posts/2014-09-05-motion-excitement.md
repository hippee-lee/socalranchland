I&#8217;m following the progress of Zurb&#8217;s Foundation For Apps. They have published some ideas related to erasing the difference between native mobile apps and web apps on a mobile device.

As I plan the interface for OnReMe I&#8217;m interested in using native browser tools to create the building blocks of an app that can be reused, content and API back-end independent. Much of what I have experienced in the first jQuery, then iOS and currently AngulerJS development cycles is that creating your UI depends on the data. I can make all the pretty mock ups I want. But, until I have fungible data to kick around in the app I don&#8217;t really know what I don&#8217;t know. This means that pretty design ideas, while important if the API isn&#8217;t ready yet, must remain flexible and evolve dynamically as the understanding of the service that access to the data provides. Because I don&#8217;t know things like implementation specific business rules that affect view structure, I need a general app framework that stays flexible as I put different things into it. Motion, Animation and smooth transitions are a big part of the boilerplate things that need to be used effectively to make an app feel native int the device browser.

Here is a quick sketch of some ideas I have collected and am curating on one of my trello boards:
