I am adding a new tag so that I can organize the things I have written down in the book Julie got me for Christmas.The name of the book is &#8220;Five&#8221; by Dan Zadra.

I went through it once to understand it and then again to record my details. Now it&#8217;s time to publish them so I can track my progress.

The book itself is a very nicely designed concept book. Through a thoughtful layout and color scheme it presents the tools that anyone has at their disposal to answering the question,

> &#8220;Where will you be five years from today?&#8221;

The question and answer format is interesting; it forces the reader to focus inward for the answers. And as fond as I am of snowboarding the Vasquez Cirque by myself or gentle morning yoga sessions that focus more on the mind than the body; I do very little inward directed thought to answer questions. Most of questions can be answered with a quick web search. However, for questions like this, there is no way to Google an easy or quick answer. As I went through the exercises the first time one thing became apparent. I have become very dependent on internet search to answer my<!--more--> questions, so much so that the really difficult questions, the ones only I can answer are even harder for me to answer because I am expecting instant gratification. I am not used to working through rambling half answers and cobbling together a cohesive and comprehensive answer that is satisfying. I want an easy answer to where I will be in five years but there is no index with that information, there is no web app that can help me. The book doesn&#8217;t give me those answers either. What it does give is questions that will help me. Questions that only I have the answers to. The hard thing is that I must be the one to make them up if they are to come to pass.<figure id="attachment_1705" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
