&#8220;Why do you run from them?&#8221; she asks him. A simple question with an answer like all answers &#8211; more complicated the the deeper you get under the surface of what&#8217;s obvious. The human psyche is a hall full of smoke and mirrors. Even when we choose the right path we are lucky more often than we are right.&nbsp;
  
The question that he poses back to her is apt enough to catch her attention. &nbsp;&#8220;What makes you think that I did not ask them to follow along so I could go faster?&#8221;&nbsp;

&#8220;Little one,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we can always choose who joins our long walk along the path.&#8221;

And with that, they are well met. Well met in the parlance of history long forgotten and remembered by only a few few who were there in the beginning.&nbsp;
