This morning, running out the door to work Julie stopped me and said, &#8220;Hey come here I have something for you to do.&#8221;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 

My reply was to sigh and so ok, what is it. SInce my mind was already out the door on my day, and the noon bike ride I had planned.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 

She said, &#8221; come upstairsÃƒâ€šÃ‚ with me&#8230;&#8221;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 

She gave me Hannah when I got to the top of the stairs. Holding my daughter I followed her in to the office where she got her camera and then led us into theÃƒâ€šÃ‚ nursery. &#8220;We are going to take pictures of the Giraffes for your Aunt Lulu,&#8221; she said. A light bulb went off in my mind.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 

So I sat Hannah in her boppy and took a seat next to her. The Giraffes are thirty two years apart in age but you can tell that they are related. Mine has faded white fuzzy skin, ragged hair on its main and dilapidated horns on top of its head. It is still standing but it kind of leans over to the one side now.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ Hannah&#8217;sÃƒâ€šÃ‚ Giraffe is a little taller, completely full of stuffing and bright, bright yellow. My giraffe stood next<!--more--> to me and Hannah pulled hers into her lap and smiled for the camera. Such a little cutie.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 

Aunt Lulu is actually my Grandma Iacobucci&#8217;s sister and she makes several stuffed animals for a hobby. Thinking of Aunt Lulu&#8217;s craftiness reminded me of Grandma I. I wish Hannah could meet her. THe amazing thing about Aunt Lulu&#8217;s design is that it is so simple. There is just a fuzzy skin, some longer, soft string for a mane, and some kind of firm stuffing. There are no beads or buttons for eyes but You can still tell that is is a giraffe, well I can. I remember when Julie fist saw mine, I think she was a little creeped out because her mid twenties boyfriend still had a stuffed animal in his closet. I think she called it a horse but I am not sure. I was offended andÃƒâ€šÃ‚ immediatelyÃƒâ€šÃ‚ corrected her. ğŸ™‚
