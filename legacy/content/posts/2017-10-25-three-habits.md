  1. Late nights snacking
  2. Inconsistent exercise
  3. Creating ideas without the plan of action

And here are some habits I want to acquire (or strengthen)

  2. Exercise and flexibility
  3. Continuous learning (think tech like Haskell and comp sci&nbsp;
  4. Wake up early
  5. Go to bed early
