Hannah was decorating a card for Mama Rosa and we told her to sign it. I told her the letters and she wrote them. It ended up on two lines because the blue and the brown decorations were in the way ðŸ™‚<figure id="attachment_2290" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

In other news, Colorado&#8217;s weather remains predictably unpredictable. Yesterday we had warm temps in the 80&#8217;s and mostly clear and sunny sky&#8217;s. Today it is raining with temps in the mid thirties, cloudy and I saw snow flakes in the air and on cars this morning. I need to get up to Jones Pass when we get back from Costa Rica &#8230;
