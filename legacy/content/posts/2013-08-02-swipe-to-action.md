Watching the Apple dev videos and playing with the iOS7 beta has given me ideas for transitions between content.
  
A swipe to action includes a transition that splits the current view and moves the halves out of viewport for destruction. Even if its a refresh could be new. The video playing in my mind is that of the person holding a picture of a person holding a picture on endless gifified loop.
