We went to Costco tonight to pick up a few things. While I was waiting for the guy to check on the camera model I wanted, I entertained Hannah with the piano. I mostly played keys and a few cords. Hannah banged on a few keys too but she was mostly interested in the buttons and knobs. 

Then we started naming things. There was a display of iPods and Hannah astutely pointed out the apple logo that was just at her height and about twice as big as her head. 

She pointed and said, &#8216;apple.&#8217;

&#8216;Very good,&#8217; I said, &#8216;apple.&#8217; 

Then she promptly went over and tried to take a bite out of it. 

It was too much when she she turned around with a puzzled expression on her face and pointed to her nose (that got squashed against the display). 

&#8216;Nose!&#8217; She said. It still comes out sounding like, &#8216;noooo.&#8217; 

&#8216;Nose,&#8217; I said cracking a grin. &#8216;You can&#8217;t eat that silly.&#8217;

&#8216;Nooooo!&#8217; she exclaimed and ran over to see the tv that was taller then her.
