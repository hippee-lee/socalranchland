It is almost Thanksgiving and as I start to reflect on all of the things I have to be thankful for, I cannot forget this one. Were it not for my Dad&#8217;s many years of hard work and dedication to his family I would not be where I am today.

I can&#8217;t say it in enough way&#8217;s and sometimes the simplest way is the best, &#8220;Thanks Dad, for everything!&#8221; Congratulations and I hope you enjoy your retirement, you have earned it.
