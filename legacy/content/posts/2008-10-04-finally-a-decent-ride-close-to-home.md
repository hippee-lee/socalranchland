Riding new trails is always fun, at least the first time. Owen and I rode the new connector trail at Heil Ranch. Not extremely steep but a good fun trail. There are some rocky parts that can be a little technical. The speed up, slow down technical to keep your balance. There were some nice fast lines on the new connector trail to. And then coming down back to the Heil Ranch parking lot was fast and bumpy. 

It reminded me a little bit of the Hummingbird trail in Simi. A good trail that I&#8217;ll have to ride again and connect with the Hall Ranch loop. That will be a really fun ride. It would be good for hiking too, if they allowed dogs. Boulder is really weird about that. I just don&#8217;t get it I guess.
