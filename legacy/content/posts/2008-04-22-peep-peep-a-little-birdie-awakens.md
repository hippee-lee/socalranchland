    On Friday, when I fed Hannah dinner, she started a new behavior. When I gave her the sign for &#8216;eat&#8217; and showed her the spoonful of baby food she opened her mouth like a little birdie. It was very cute. She did it until she got full or tired of the repetition. Watching her this past weekend I saw that she is starting to give signs of wanting but I don&#8217;t think she knows she is doing it yet. Besides opening her mouth like a little bird, sheÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â has moments when she only wants Momma :)Ã‚Â

    Good weekend, great weather. We went for two &#8216;hikes&#8217; this weekend with Hannah. Last Saturday Julie and I got up early, went to breakfast at the farmers market on 11th St. Later we went up to the Bebaso trail/loop west of Boulder. Hannah first hike was fun. She fell asleep for the first half but was awake for the last mile or so.Ã‚Â On Sunday we went with Cory, Jen and Mason and walked around on the Boulder Creek Path. Both hikes were great little warmups and I look forward to some good backpacking with her.Ã‚Â

    Also, little miss I hate tummy time is<!--more--> starting to go from her back to her front when she sees something interesting that she wants. If you put her down on her stomach, sheÃ‚Â immediatelyÃ‚Â flips over 180 degrees to her back. But, if something catches her eye, and she is on her back, she will reach and twist most of her body over to tummy side to get what she wants.Ã‚Â

    We took the pups with us and they had a great time. I got repriminded by the dude form open spaces because Gurgi was not on a leash. Even though he was on heel next to my side. I saw a bunch of places where some well meaning person had but branches across the traiL,Ã‚Â ostentatiouslyÃ‚Â to stopÃ‚Â mountainÃ‚Â bikers from riding the line in the trail that takes you up the bank of the trail. I am not sure why they do this but is is pretty dangerous for theÃ‚Â mountainÃ‚Â bikers. Ã‚Â Boulders attitude to Mountain Bikers and Dogs is the weirdest I have seen; in all of the places I have lived. Apparently, open mindedness,Ã‚Â understandingÃ‚Â and harmonious living do not apply to Mountain Bikers and Canines.Ã‚Â
