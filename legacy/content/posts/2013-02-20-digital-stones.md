Teaching Hannah how to run her iPod touch was easy, I just had to play with the settings and shines noises. Then when I take a picture of it, she tells me to wait. And she asks me how to resign the keyboard from the screen. 

So when she steps on her first digital stones and wants to move them around, i can only smile and agree.
