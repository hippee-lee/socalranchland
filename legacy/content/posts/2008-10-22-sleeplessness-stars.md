You have had some trouble adjusting to time zones. I doubt that you can even comprehend the distances involved in delineating the Maui time from the Denver time zone, yet.

That&#8217;s ok, you have plenty of time to figure it out. Personally, I think it is harder to adjust when traveling west several zones and by the end of the week in Hawaii you were almost adjusted, then we flew you back.

Now, at night, you are used to having momma and pappa in the same room, lots of quality one on one time with your parental units, and some late night snuggle time thrown in for good measure. That&#8217;s prolly how you ended up I&#8217;m my lap at 1 o&#8217;clock in the morning, looking at the stars on your ceiling and giving them names. We gave one to momma, bo the horse, Clyde the boxer, and called some others alphyomeggy, deltus and betus. By the time I named the moon: luceylunus; you were fast asleep.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ 

I just had fun with you falling asleep in my lap cause you are soÃƒâ€šÃ‚ snuglyÃƒâ€šÃ‚ and warm. ðŸ™‚
