There was an impromptu Iacobucci get together at the Buca Di Peppe in downtown Columbus tonight. There was:

  * Good food (Bread, butter and olive oil, pizza, moist chicken that tasted lemony, spagetti, rigatoni, beer and wine)
  * Good conversation
  * Kids &#8216;n Chaos
  * The promise to meet again tomorrow for Susie&#8217;s wedding and do it all over again

  Here are the photos from dinner. I don&#8217;t usually upload ful size files but the two images of our group outside the restaurant are (they weigh in at over 10MB) so they could be downloaded and printed. Ask me for any of the others if you want them &#8211; I can post the full size image and give you a link.
