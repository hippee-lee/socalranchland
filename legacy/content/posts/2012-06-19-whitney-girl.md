She was born in the California desert and we first met her on our way to Vegas. She was sweet and wiggled alot and had the most beautiful golden colored eyes I ever did see.

She made the trip to Colorado in ought six and then back again this spring. Bouncy and always full of life, even when she was being a little bitchy or taunting horses and cows in the pasture. Perhaps even more so then. Happy to sit in the sun with Mr. Clyde and [Gurgi](http://hippeelee.com/blog/2011/10/gurgis-last-day/ "Gurgiâ€™s Last Day") after him or, she would just flat out run. I will miss this one.
