It wad a nice weekend but a little busy.

On Saturday, Hannah and I went to the childrens hospital near our house. There Hannah got to see real a real fire truck, an ambulance, and a police car. The vehicles she was fascinated with. The vehicle operators, not so much. Then we were supposed to go to the Erie concert in the park but it looked to much like bad weather so Mason, Riley and Shaye (and the associsted parental units) joinednus for
  
Some play in the back yard. After some sprinkles, it turned into a pretty nice evening.

Today, Julie motivated me to get the bike trailer out and we took Hannah and the dogs on Ride around Vista Ridge. We stopped at the clubhouse and had a late breakfast. There are a few more things to do today but it should be pretty mellow.
