Hannah is learning about Outer space in her class. Planets, the sun the solar system and al of that stuff.

Tonight we were playing with words and talking about the house and somehow glue got brought up. Juie asker her, &#8220;What kind of glue?&#8221;

&#8220;Gravity glue that lives under the house and keeps it down.&#8221; Was her answer.

While funny, I thought that it was a pretty profound explanation of the theory of general relativity, for a three year old.
