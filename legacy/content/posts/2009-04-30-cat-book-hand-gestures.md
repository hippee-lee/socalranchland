Hannah wanted to read the cat book this morning. We read it twice. Her favorite part was where the little kitten pops out of the rain boot and I say, &#8220;meow, meow, meow!&#8221;

Then we went through the alphabet cards. She is picking up more hand gestures from school, plus she is part Itallian and Italians talk with their hands. At least my family does, you should see the holiday gatherings!.

The picture is a beautiful contrast of human emotion although I am not sure if Hannah is really sad. Her eyes have the exasperated look in them to; as if she has stuff to do and places to be and why sit here for a picture. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think?
