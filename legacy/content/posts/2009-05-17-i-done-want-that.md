That&#8217;s Hannahs second two word combo. 

Context: She was eating mac and cheese ( my favorite meal for as far back as I can remember ) and saw me put the pudding cups into the fridge. 

She pushed her plate of mac and cheese away and pointed the pudding and said, &#8216;I done. Want that.&#8217;
