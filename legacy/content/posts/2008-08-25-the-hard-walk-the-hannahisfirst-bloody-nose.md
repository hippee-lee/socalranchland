Hannah is hard at work trying to learn to walk. She really doesn&#8217;t like to crawl much, I don&#8217;t think it is fast enough for her. Every day she gets more adventurous with her walking attempts. I see her just standing there practicing her balance alot; her stance reminds me of a snowboarder or skater stance when you are riding at speed. Besides practicing her balance by standing there, sometimes she coordinates everything together and can take 4-5 steps no problem. Other times the coordination things messes up her plans and she loses her balance.

This weekend we went up near Lyons to visit a co-worker of Julie&#8217;s who has a son, Logan, very close to Hannah&#8217;s age. They were playing together and crawling around all over the place. When we went out to their deck Hannah tried to walk through the door but got tripped up coming through the doorway. She fell forward and bonked her face üôÅ A few minutes later all was better cause she was in Mommas arms and we noticed that she had a tiny bit of blood inside one of her nostrils. Her first bloody nose.

We had anouther pretty active weekend. Saturday after getting breakfast at<!--more--> the farmers market we did a short 45 minute hike. We started at Settlers peak and hiked up to the top. Going up the trail was pretty good but the trail we came down was a little sketchy (I was only wearing Tevas and I am sure that didn&#8217;t help). The dogs had fun playing in the creeks we crossed and socializing with the other dogs my co-workers brought. Then we grilled out in the park and played a little in the creek. We had mexican for dinner and got to order Hannah her first kids meal at a restaurant. She decided to get cheese quesadillas. Then Julie and I took her to the last Erie concert in the park. I forget the band that played but it was fun and Hannah got to dance with us and walk around to see everything that was going on. Another very good weekend. This picture is of me and my little geek girl. I am looking at the video camera and she is looking at the camera case. Ah, pretty soon she will have her own logins on my systems and all of that fun stuff.
