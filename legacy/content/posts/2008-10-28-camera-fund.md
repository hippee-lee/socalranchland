The supposedly waterproof movie camera was not so waterproof. I am in the process of either getting it repaired or reimbursed for it under the credit card warranty. I submitted the initial paperwork and need to check online to see what the status of it is.

I am also starting a camera fund so I can get a new movie/dlsr camera. I already know which model I want, <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html" target="_blank">this one</a>. Since it will take really good pictures and movies its the best of both worlds. One think I found with the movie camera is that I take alot of one to three minute clips that get edited together. Not being a movie, my life doesn&#8217;t require 24/7 filming to capture the memorable moments.Ã‚Â 

The strategy for having a camera fund is two fold:Ã‚Â 

  1. I don&#8217;t have $1500 cash lying around and I don&#8217;t want to charge this purchase &#8230;
  2. By the time the fund has enough money for the purchase the price may have come down because of new models, competition or a decent used model might be on craigslist.

I want to put a fund tracking widget on the splash page so I can track its progress with a graph/chart. Also, I could<!--more--> put a donate to me link in case total strangers want to help me take high quality pictures of Hannah and Julie
