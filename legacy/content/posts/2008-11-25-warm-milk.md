The upstairs gets cold at night. It seems like ten degrees cooler but I haven&#8217;t measures with a thermometer yet. While Julie and I were out Xmas shopping ok our date night we got ceramic room heater because you have been waking up with cold ears, nose and toes. I set it up tonight and it seems to keep your room much warmer. 

I don&#8217;t think that is why you don&#8217;t want to sleep though. We lookedcat stars and the moon for a while, then we read &#8216;Ten In The Bed.&#8217; Finally I got you some milk, in case you were hungary. Hopfully a post midnigt snack will do the trick.
