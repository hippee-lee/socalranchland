Toasting tips:
  
Write out the toast and practice practice practice, out loud. Not a speech so keep it short enough to memorize. Practice it twice on the day of the speech. Keep some notes in your pocket. Stick to a simple format: talk a bit about who is being toasted and your shared history with them. Follow up and close with a sincere wish on their behalf.
