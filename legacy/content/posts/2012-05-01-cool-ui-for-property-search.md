I came across [PadMapper.com](http://www.padmapper.com/) on Hacker News and being in the market took a look. I liked what I saw, being in the market there is not much to like about the real estate industry. From the way they federate their data and make it as hard as possible for their customers to find what they are looking for, to the cumbersome option selection they provide.

What I liked about PadMappers UI is this:

  * The map is the page, just like if I were to spread a real map out on my table.
  * The controls are live. I make an adjustment and **the map responds** to me.

If I was looking to rent it would be the best housing search experience I can find. How much does zillow charge for access to their feed and can I scrape from the rest of the federated property info? Hmmm.
