Saturday morning I rode the 25 mile loop near Gold Hill Trailhead. Still can&#8217;t do it under four hours but it is still a pretty fun ride.
  
Sunday morning we took Hannah on her first real hike with Whitney and Gurgi. We walked the 7.5 mile loop at Walker Ranch and it aeems i wore everyone out: dogs, daughter and wife. Towards the end J and I got annoyed with each other but worked it out. We may be in trouble when Hannah learns the art of manipulation.
  
After dinner I went out to Bo and threw the saddle on him for a few laps. He did well, I can almost get him to do a few large circles at a gallup. Got bit up by moaquitos, we need to bring some bug spray out to keep with the tack.
  
As I write this I am getting some quality one one one Hannah time. Litterly, she is using me as a pillow before I put her down for the night. I don&#8217;t know if it helps her sleep through the night better or not, but I like to spend this quit time with her just reflecting.
  
I was definatly in the moment this weekend. I<!--more--> am very lucky.
