Patio is done, whew. Julie helped tremendously and I think it was more work than she realized. She was also able to take care of Hannah alot of the time so kudos to her for multi tasking. Cory helped to and its prolly because of him that we got done yesterday.

My estimated totals are:

Bricks and wall blocks moved &#8211; 10,000 to 12,000 lbs

Wall foundation and road base moved &#8211; 22 tons

Mason sand for paver leveling &#8211; 2.5 tons

Equipment rentals &#8211; one paver saw for a day, one 225lb 14&#8243; ground pounder rented twice.

Lessons learned &#8211; estimated wall block and pavers is not an exact science&#8230; we have almost a pallet extra of rectangular pavers (but just the right amount of square pavers) and we have about 3/4 of a pallet of extra wall blocks. Next time I need to hire a day laborer to help move stuff from the front the back and seriously consider renting one of the hand powered front end loaders to help with moving/loading/excavating.

In Hannah news she is standing like mad (with assistance) and can almost push herself up into a sitting position on her own. I give it a week ands she will be sitting up<!--more--> on her own. The same goes for crawling. When she is in a sitting position she will see something she wants that is just out of reach and lean forward like she is going to crawl to it but then she seems to think about it and decides to wait just a little bit longer.

It is really time to order some baby proofing stuff. We need the portable baby pens, top and bottom stair gates and cupboard locks to start with.
