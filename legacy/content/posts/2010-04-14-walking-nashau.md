After day two of the CMS training in Nashau, NH i taxied over to Greely Park and walked along the river.

i was reminded how much fun it is to pretend to be an explorer when walking in the woods, just like I used to do in the Ravine at my childhood home. I think the light filtering through the trees had something to do with it.

I decided to save the $10 cab fare and walk home through some nice nieghborhoods. I don&#8217;t think the charlie horse on my thigh appreciated it. Thats ok, its gotten a free ride since i ran into that tree After skidding out mid-carve two weekends ago. Do&#8217;h.
