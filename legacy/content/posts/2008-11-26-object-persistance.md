I used to be able to put things out of Hannahs sight and she would turn her attention else where. Now she remembers the object and seeks it out. 

Tonight she was playing with the dog leashes and I put them up because she was tripping on them. Age went over to the counter top and tried to climb up to reach them. A bit later she was spilling milk all over the aerobed. I put the milk behind me off the bed and she promptly got off the bed and went over and got it from behind my back. 

She is also doing these funny behaviors: cuddling &#8211; she will come over and crawl into you lap if you are sitting or crawl on top of you if you are lying down. She signed cat last night when Bella joined us and wanted tonpet her. That was one of the first signs we started wit but I have not given it to her for a while. Other signs she knows include: more, drink, eat, mamma/pappa (I think she does the same for both) dog &#8211; but very similar to cat it seems, up, blows kisses and she is starting to<!--more--> do diaper, when we change the dirty ones. I am also showing a finger over my lops while sayi g shh for quiet time and hands on the side of my tilted head for sleep sleep time.
