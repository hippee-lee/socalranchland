I want lights that are quickly configurable. There are two lights in Hannah&#8217;s room and I turn them off several times a day. I want a program to manage it for me that can:

  * handle all the lights in the room, hard wired or plugged into an outlet
  * manage independent schedules for each light
  * understand motion knowledge in the room for smart management
  * work with a simple UI from any device, like Nest
