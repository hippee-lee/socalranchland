It was all green lights this morning on my way to work. I was thinking aboutÃƒâ€šÃ‚ Maui next week with the family, and really looking forward to it.

I am off tommorow and here is what I want to get done:

  1. take Hannah and the pups for jaunt around the long Vista Ridge loop
  2. go for a ride on Bo out to the fields by I-25
  3. find the dive book so Hannah can help me review on the plane
  4. photoshop a mock up of the graphics I made for my splash page
  5. clean the house

I had better get up early so I can get a jump start on that list ðŸ™‚
