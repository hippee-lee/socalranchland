Today she is three. I took the day off and we went down to the Denver Children&#8217;s Museum. We got there when it opened and I think we got to all of the activities, some of them twice.

There was the fire truck, of course. And then we did a bit of shopping at the grocers after we did some construction. There were crayon rubbings and tree house tunnels and we used the words and shapes magnets for a while. Even I made some fun sentences.

We had snacks and then surveyed the outside playground. Hannah could do three of the monkey bars by herself! Then we went back inside and did some more construction and attended to some animals in the vet clinic and headed home.

Got home a little after one and she slept for an hour and a half. Then when she woke up she had a melt down because her peanut butter and nubutella sandwitch wasn&#8217;t evenly distributed when she peeled the slices of bread apart. both the pb and nubutella ended up on one piece. I cannot describe how traumatic this i for a three year old. It must be experienced. After assesing the situation I recommended that she<!--more--> only eat the slice with both the pb and nubutella on it. Hannah concurred saying, &#8220;you eat that one, its bad.&#8221;

We ended lunch with an orange sucker that was near the nubutella and plan on hitting the park, possibly with a skateboard.
