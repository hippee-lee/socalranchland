I went to Ohio for Easter this year. Katie and Rob came down from Montana and then we Drove from Colorado to Cleveland with Hannah and the pups. Total time on the road was right around 48 hours there and back. It only took about twenty hours to go city to city. Weather wise it was pretty good. On the way there we hit some snow in Chicago that got worse the closer we got to Cleveland but that was all.

Gurgi and Whitney got a little tired near the end of the adventure, so did everyone. Hannah did awsome. We did a lot of driving at night so she slept. But, during the day she was happy to smile, play with her toys and talk to everyone. We listened to a nineteen hour book on cd: Lisey&#8217;s Story by Steven King and I am the only one who liked it.
