I was able to figure out how to hook emacs up to an ipad at work today. It&#8217;s still pretty simple stuff, load the webpage I am working on and pop alerts. But still, if I can figure out how to debug the errors and get the command to send JavaScript to the device working &#8230; this could be a huge timesaver for debugging mobile applications.

I&#8217;m tagging this as a milestone only because it involves emacs, node.js and a mobile device.
