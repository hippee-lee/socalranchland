I took Hannah over to the pumpkin patch hosted at the Vista Ridge Community center. We did everything. We decorated yet another pumpkin &#8230; I think we should make seeds but have yet to google a good process for cleaning and roasting the seeds. We hit the jumpy spiderman bounce house and talked to some nice people from the neighborhood. Then, some of Hannahs other lilac circle friends showed up and she helped them decorate. 

On our way home we stopped at 711 and got some gase, a belly buster and poweraid because there wasn&#8217;t much to drink there and we were thirsty. Yum. Now it is off to a halloween party hosted by primrose friends.
