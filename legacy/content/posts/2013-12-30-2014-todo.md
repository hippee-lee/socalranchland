There are three things I will finish this year:

1) The Story that has need rolling around my head all these years ( mashulg, silent guild & the mellonheads)
  
2) The Song that exists only in my head and when I play it for Hannah AND the Xmas song for next year with extempore
  
3) The Images &#8211; the pictures that complement both The Story and The Song need to graduate from doodles into finished files. 

This is not a reinvention year, it is a refinement and enhancement year. I am accountable to deliver three things created with the skills, knowledge and experiences that make me, me.
