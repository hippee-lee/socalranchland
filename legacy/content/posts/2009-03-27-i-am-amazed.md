So the late winter snowstorm threw a monkey wrench into my plans. Cheryle and Paul&#8217;s flight was canceled so I get to swap snowboarding for Hannah duty.

So far today we have had our morning coffee and milk, opened and closed the blinds over fifty times and played 52 card pickup with the flash cards.

What amazed me though is that Hannah decided it was elmo time and she didn&#8217;t want to read the books. She went over the the tv (which i forgot to re -child lock) and opened the door to the DVD player where her elmo DVD&#8217;s are, picked up Sesame Street &#8211; Count With Me DVD and tried to put it into the player. All this just from watching me and Julie put dvds in to play. Amazing.

I&#8217;ll trade snowboarding for Hannah time anyday because riding is always there, but I can never have enough Hannah time. And she will only be little once.

Our plans for later today are to go to REI and exchange my hat, visit Julie in Longmont for lunch, look for a split board at the store Julie said is going out of business, naps and shoveling the driveway so it doesn&#8217;t turn into a<!--more--> sheet of ice.
