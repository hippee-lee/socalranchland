Momma went to the movies last night. We got to hang out with the dogs and Bella. First I fed you dinner, a mixture of squash and something else orange. You had been snacking on cheese and were showing very little interest in eating so I let you use your own hands to feed yourself. While you were making a mess and feeding yourself I was able to get a few more spoonfuls in. I tried to get you to drink some of the whole milk we are starting you on but you were not a big fan of it.Ã‚Â 

Then it was bath time. You really like bath time. I tried your momma&#8217;s approach of putting you in the tub standing up while the water warmed up. Then we did some bubble bath soap and you were so interested in the bubbles that you stuck your face under the water. It was only a second before you stood straight up, gasping for air. I guess you wanted a closer look at the bubbles.Ã‚Â 

After bath time we took the dogs for a walk. Bella followed us to the mailboxes so we had to pick her up and take her back<!--more--> to the house. We saw Mason out and dropped of the OSX Leopard Disc so Cory could upgrade his computer. Then we went around the school as usual and over to the Healthy Bone. I wanted to exchange the choke chain I got for Gurgi, the one I got onÃ‚Â SaturdayÃ‚Â is a little long. You were getting a little cranky so I hurried you home. I think you got tired of being in the stroller. You were no longer interested in the snack pack andÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â not the milk in the sippy cup.Ã‚Â 

It was about 7pm when we got home so we played with your toys. You chased the kitty a little bit, climbed on your leopard skin rocking chair, knocked over a stack of buckets, nine high, several times and jumped on me while laughing and giggling. Oh yes you were really into hammering the toy that has plastic balls which go through the holes and then roll out the bottom. You are walking really well now, when you want, you can walkÃ‚Â acrossÃ‚Â the room in the little shoes we got for you. I think you will be running around by the time we get to Hawaii to see all four of your grandparents.
