In my second experience with Fandango I like them even worse. We won&#8217;t focus on the lack of usability on their website but to say that it was less than optimal and more than painful to get the information I was trying to find.

Related to this sub par experience with them is the Google Offers (I&#8217;m not sold on the whole internet coupons as a value proposition for myself either but Julie is a bit more trusting than I am) Fandango tickets we purchased and can&#8217;t use because they are expiring before we can use them at a different theater later this week. We already made plans to meet other folks at a specific theater but unfortunately for us crapdango tells me that **Online Ticketing Not Available for this Theater.**

Huh, so let me get this straight, they sell movie tickets but when I want to buy them they can&#8217;t sell them to me. I recall the first time I balked because they tried to force me to register for an account and charge me an extra couple of dollars for tickets. I guess I&#8217;m at a loss to the value they provide. I have never had a hard time getting tickets<!--more--> to a movie at the door so why would I pay them extra to send some digital bits over the internet for me to not have to pull out my credit card?

Fast forwarding to tonight it is a little frustrating that they would sell a coupon that is not easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that some of it may be due to us not reading the fine print (who does and is not a lawyer?) or being regular customers of theirs but with regards to what I dislike about the whole online coupon fad is that the seller has all the upside. If for any reason I am unable to use the coupon I am out everything and this is very different from how coupons used to be when they were clipped from dead trees. There was no risk to me and I wouldn&#8217;t mind giving them my information in exchange for a better deal that I could normally get.

I&#8217;m pretty sure I will be able to talk Julie out of even considering them again with a simple &#8220;I&#8217;s just not worth the hassel to try and work with them so we can save a few dollars.&#8221; I know I&#8217;ll avoid them like the plague whenever I do anything movie related and be happy they don&#8217;t have a change to put any dark light on my movie experience. Their website and service is confusing and hard to use and they offered a coupon that was impossible to use. I wonder how this works for them, it took them over five years to get $5 from us. Going forward not only will we avoid their services but I&#8217;ll have a written memory of specific reasons you should also avoid them. It&#8217;s just not worth your time and they can&#8217;t save you any money.
