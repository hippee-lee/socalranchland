Trouble shooting with dad; tonight&#8217;s session:

Starting with iPhoto, we went over some basic things to get started. I showed him navigating in the iPhoto app itself. We went to one of the recent items and looked at the pictures there, the photo library and an album that already existed. Then, I had him make a new photo album, multi select several photos and add them to the new album. Then we renamed the newly created album. Next we made a slide show from the photo album. We selected all the pictures in the new album &#8216;chris&#8217; and modifed some of the slideshow settings. 

Then we moved on to trouble shooting the scanning issue. First, we made sure all images in the scanned photos folder had been imported into iPhoto, then we deleted the old scans. The HP Scan software was having trouble connecting to his scanner so I deleted the printer and re-added it using the system preferences &#8211;> print & fax. This re-installed the drivers for his printer. Next, we went through the scanning procedure that he is already familiar with: start HP Scan, preview image, choose saving options and scan the photo. We both scanned and saved a photo<!--more--> and it worked for me and then for dad.Then we quit the scanning software application, restarted and made sure it still worked. It did.

The only minor glitch was the yuuguu software seemed to be having some trouble, the server kept falling behind and my view of his screen kept freezing. So we restarted several times and got through the session. Too bad apples iChat screen sharing is even more buggy than that, it does not even work. It just gives an error after he accepts the invitation to start screen sharing. üôÅ
