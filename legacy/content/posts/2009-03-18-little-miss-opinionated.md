Hannah strongly did not want me to get her dressed or brush her teeth this morning. She had to do it herself. 

She also wanted Mammas muffin but could not have it. When she started complaining mamma used a bit if sarcasm in her voice when she told Hannah how mean we are. Do todlers understand sarcasm? Or did she just know that we were talking about her?
