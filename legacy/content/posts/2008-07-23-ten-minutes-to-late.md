The Silver Rush MTB race was fun but I didn&#8217;t finish. Grrr, I am annoyed with myself for taking to many breaks. I got to the 1/2 way point in 4 hours and 10 minutes and the cutoff time was four hours. Next year besides the AM Train I will need to ride the HA (High Altitude) Train alot more. I plan on going up to the colorado trail between Frisco and Breckenridge and doing that as an out and back. It won&#8217;t be fifty miles but it should be close to forty and its at a decently high altitude. Riding or pushing a bike at 11,000+ feet is pretty hard.

Hannah news; she is waving, almost saying Hi and crawling with a peg leg. She uses one leg to crawl like normal and the other leg is used with the foot flat on the ground to propel her around. She is pretty quick when she seesÃ‚Â somethingÃ‚Â she wants to go after like Momma, the dogs food dishes or the Bella the cat. Her legs are getting a bit of balance in them. I have seen her stand up unassisted, with no hands, for almost 20-30 seconds and she is taking<!--more--> her furniture surfing to anouther level. When she sees something that she can use for support she edges herself as close to it as she can get from her current support object and then tries to reach it with her hands. If she can reach it she goes over otherwise she sits down and thinks about it before crawling over to it.

Momma Rosa and Pappa Rosa are in town this week to get some quality Hannah time in so Hopefully she will have lots of fun with them.
