Very busy this week. I did an AM Train on monday but haven&#8217;t ridden since then. GOAL: make to the 1/2 way point in under 4 hours!

When Julie is sick and Hannah can&#8217;t have unlimited access to her momma, Hannah gets cranky. She is getting very curious about her environment, crawling around and trying to pull herself up on all kinds of things. I need to do the stair gates because she likes to climb. The door and cupboards need locks and we shall fasten several pieces of furniture to the wall (Faulkner Library in the living room, the bookshelf in Hannah&#8217;s room and theÃ‚Â armoireÃ‚Â in Hannah&#8217;s room

Work stuff thats keeping me hopping: trying to figure out a perl script to do a custom data transfer for forbes(not working) and I need to figure out why my xmlHttpRequest is working in firefox but not crappy internet explorer for the rjr-pingback offer.
