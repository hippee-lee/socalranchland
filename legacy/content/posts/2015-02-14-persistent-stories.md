I have heard that some are worried that there is all this really important data hidden in spreadsheets and tied to an app and an OS. And that data may not be parsible in fifty or a hundred years. And that may be so. But, our knowledge is still passed on in the oral tradition. And now it&#8217;s an easily persists or audio visual tradition. It&#8217;s funny, how the more things change, technology, the more they stay the same, good story telling.<!--more-->

We add to it everyday. While I still think photos from a Dslr are better than the phones, the phones near ubiquity means that I can tell my story and persist it as is. Up load to my server and snapshot it once a month. Take precaution with a simple backup and make sure Hannah can find and use the keys. I believe that&#8217;s more important, right now. More important than mining all my spreadsheets for data. What I am lacking is an audio visual tool to annotate things that are important to me. A way to color the layers for those who listen tomorrow.
