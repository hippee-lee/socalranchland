\*\*UPDATE\*\* it turned out very well for Obama. Yay. Now he has to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. I really hope that he is better than either Bush or Clinton at working with others in the middle. The republicans lost alot of moderates so that will make things interesting for Obama and for the republican party itself. Could this be the start of a third party? Could the republican party split into two different parties, one party of fiscal conservatives and social moderated and the other of religious conservatives? Since I tend to identify myself as a social moderate and a fiscal conservative I hope so. The reason I couldn&#8217;t vote for McCain is because he pandered to the extreme vote on the edge. I wonder how I would have voted had he run a campaign like in 2000? The choice would definitely been harder. 

I cast my ballot on the pile today. We&#8217;ll see how it turns out. Google news has a cool election status at the top of the news page.
