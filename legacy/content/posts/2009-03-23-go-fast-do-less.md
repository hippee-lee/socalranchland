That is the main point of <a title="Go Fast, Do Less" href="http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-write-fast-code.html" target="_self">this pos</a>[t](http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-write-fast-code.html). I think it also applies to other things besides coding, things I am more familiar with like snowboarding, mountain biking and other real world activities.

When snowboarding if you want to go fast Turn less and just go straight. Depending on your skill level you may want to waer a helmet and try this when no one is around. The same for mountian biking, just brake less but at strategic times. Once you pick your line and let go. follow through with it and stay true. 

When you stay true you do less.
