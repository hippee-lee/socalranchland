**Fix the kiddo bench with tape.** There was an issue with the Ikea bench after four years of heavy use. Hannah informed us that it broke but she didn&#8217;t break it. As a proactive measure though, she fixed it with tape. How creative I think to myself when we had this conversation. And, how awesome to get to witness that comprehension, observe her growth in understanding. Maybe it is just me but the observational apsect of being a parent is fascinating. As for Hannah, she knows tape is sticky and that one can tape things together. The bench needs something sticky to keep it securely on. That makes sense. If I knew what she knows I think I would do the same. Of all the things I ever thought were cool, this is up there as the coolest.

**Decorate the fish tank.** There was a morning tummy ache yesterday. Julie stayed home with H but still had to do some work stuff. I guess she was on a conference call when Hannah decorated the fish tank. There is tha card we got from John and Lori after Grugi died and some kinderart to start with. I think the fishy&#8217;s will enjoy the<!--more--> change of scenery. I would if I only traveled through 10 gallons of water. The rainbow came later and there was also a handprint turkey but I couldn&#8217;t work it into the shot.

**Tonight,** she put 1/4 eaten cheese back into its wax and back into the fridge. I had a one of those little pads of cheese that come sealed in wax so Hannah had one. Then she had another. As I was eating dinner I noticed the second one on the table. Hannah was long gone and I was cleaning up when I looked in it. She had nibbled around a quarter of the edge and then put it back into the wax and folded it up.

&#8220;Look what our daughter did.&#8221; I said and handed it to Julie.

She just laughed that laugh of hers that I like so much. 

Later when Hannah wandered through the kitchen I she decided that we should keep it and put it into her drawer in the fridge. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll eat it later.&#8221;
