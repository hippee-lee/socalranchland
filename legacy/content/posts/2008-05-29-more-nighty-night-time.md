This late night Hannah fun is from two days ago. I had my server off for a few days so I am posting it now. She went to bed with Momma and woke up a bit earlier than usual, around 10:15pm. When she woke, boy was she ever conversational. She was talking and talking and just talking to herself i think. She talked to me all the way through her diaper change. She talked to the computer as I was shutting it down. She talked to Bella the cat when we let her out into the garage, to hunt mice.

Since she was conversational I took her into the nursery and sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to her. Well, I sang the two verses I could remember over and over. Curious as ever, she started feeling my throat while I was singing. I think it helped her find her voice cause she started singing too. She sang and hummed and cooed her way to sleep on my right shoulder instead of the usual left side. This time, when I put her down in the crib she barely made a sound. She just rolled onto her side and that was that, off like<!--more--> a light switch.

When I write a program i sometime use variables as place holders or counters that will track the progress function that uses looping to do some work for me. Everytime your program goes through the loop you have to tell it to increment the counter variable. If I have a variable named &#8216;counter&#8217; then I can use a shorthand notation to &#8216;increment counter.&#8217; This is done by writitng this: counter++. Now you understand the teeth++ above. The current value of Hannah&#8217;s teeth variable is 3.
