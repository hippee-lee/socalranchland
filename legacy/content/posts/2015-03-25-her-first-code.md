Thank you [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org). Hannah is a second grader at Pinecrest learning to multiply and divide. She is using your videos to supplement the class work and the draw with code lesson caught her eyes.&nbsp;

With a bit of help from me, she drew her &nbsp;own beautiful day. What a great tool! And red sky, that&#8217;s so way cool !!&nbsp;
