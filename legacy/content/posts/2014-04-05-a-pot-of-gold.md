&#8220;If I found a pot of gold I would be happy for my family. First I would get a puppy. Next I&#8217;d get a phone. Then I&#8217;d get a house. I&#8217;d get a water bottle. Last I&#8217;d get a mechanical pencil. I would like to have a pot of gold.&#8221; [read more for picture]

Some interesting observations here:
  
First, puppy trumps (smart) phone. Smart emphasize mine because when I tried to describe land lines to Hannah I fell pathetically short. Her response was along the lines of: So, all you could do was talk on them and leave recorded messages? That&#8217;s it?

Second, phone trumps house. 

I get the water bottle and mechanical pencil &#8211; those are popular items at school these days. If you have a unique one of theses I suspect it&#8217;s cooler.
