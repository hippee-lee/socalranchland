This past weekend, I read a blog post that talked about a data type for &#8216;me.&#8217; The argument premise is that blogs are nice and all but they don&#8217;t capture everything. They only capture a pseudo linear timeline of my output. However the data in my output is more than just what I am thing or recording on a blog. It includes emails, social media things and stuff on my computers that doesn&#8217;t have a happy home upon a cloud anywhere. 

I think there is a lot of stuff on my home computer that is not valuable in the sort term because they are just details. But, given a proper set of tools, in aggregate this information is extremely valuable to me.
  
Given the large amount of information that I am accumulating how will I get value out of it for myself in six months or six years? How will my children&#8217;s children get value out of it in six generations?
