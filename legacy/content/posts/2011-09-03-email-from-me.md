My news consumption has changed since I began using a real smart phone circa 2007. I just seem to read more news sites on that. It might be related to the sites I get news from. They usually link to short fluff type pieces and they are easy to consume without much thought or much time invested. However, I also run into the situation where I find a meatier post &#8211; something technical, something political, something educational. These are nice reads but they take time to digest and comprehend. 

I don&#8217;t like to read that kind of media on a small screen. So I email myself a link. I recently asked myself how many times I have emailed myself and the follow on questions: what is the link breakdown and body content of the messages to myself.

Here is a start to answer the first question: 

`matt@hippeelee-mbp 09/03/11 09:07:38<br />
~/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-hippely@imap.gmail.com/[Gmail].mbox/All Mail.mbox<br />
571 $ find . -name "*.emlx" | xargs cat | grep "From: "Matt Hippely"" | wc -l<br />
