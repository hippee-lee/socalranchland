Hopefully she&#8217;ll start for me when she cools back down ðŸ™‚

Thoughts I had on the way up:
  
Blender a spindrop logo. A raindrop clear bit colored with a hint of rainbow on it&#8217;s surface and slightly twisted. Around the drop there is an orange halo spinning.

The truck made it home. Had a good 3 hour session. Rode Vasquez Ridge, the baby park, Mary Jane C-lift till noon. 

Julie and clingy (Hannah) were napping so I joined them. We finished up the day with a visit to BoBo and a horseback ride.
