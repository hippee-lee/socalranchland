The Pink Elephant pj&#8217;s are for you Amy, since you liked the footie pajamas. I am not much of a fasionista, but, little girl clothes and shoes are pretty darn cute. So much so that I would even say its fun getting Hannah dressed in the morning. More fun than dressing myself since most days I could care less what I put on. When I dress Hannah, I actually think about stuff like matching and what she would like depending on the weather. Like today, its supposed to be in the sunny and temps in the mid to upper 60&#8217;s. So I dressed her in a long sleeve shirt, jeans and her active shoes. I pulled off the shell from her fleece and left it for her to wear outside when they play outside. I never would have thought that I would think or care about stuff like that. But I do, and its fun.
