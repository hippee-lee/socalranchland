Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &#8211; it has been a great Father&#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.

I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.

Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.

Later she asked me, &#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&#8221;
  
I told her &#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Then my friends are cool.&#8221; She said.

Next, we got<!--more--> some transplanting materials from the building supply store for the tomato plant and flowers. We had to go back for the cage because I forget it. Hannah observed that I can be forgetful and the we can get better at remembering things. So young to take on such a responsibility &#8230;

Finally we stopped at Costco for some dog food and lunch. On the way in she saw a boat parked in front and asked me if she could buy it. I took her to look at the price tag and it was about $30k.

I asked her, &#8220;Do you have enough money with you to buy it?&#8221;
  
She said, &#8220;No, but I didn&#8217;t bring my piggy bank or else I would.&#8221;
  
I told her that I preferred to spend my $30k on other toys. ðŸ™‚

We went in, got the dog food, a few samples and other things and then had a yummy cheese pizza lunch with 1/2 sprite and 1/2 iced tea combo drink. When we got home we found the two pill bugs we tried to save in the container; but they were not moving. I had given her a container that was airtight and forgot to tell her to keep it cracked open so the bugs can get air. I told her they were dead and it was my fault for not telling her that they needed air. She said, &#8220;No they are just sleeping and will wake up later&#8221;

Then we took our materials in the back yard and transplanted our flowers and the tomato plant for Julie. I watered the trees and shrubs and Hannah informed me that I take to long. I think this was related to the fact that I told her she could wash off the pots after I was done watering. I was so slow that it was causing her physical pain, I think.

Finally we finished up and picked up our tools and decided to go out to BoBo. We took her bike because she wanted to ride it at the barn. We brushed BoBo down and picked his feet as usual. Hannah dicided to ride so I threw on his saddle and led them out to the pasture to graze and ride. Then Hannah decided she wanted to walk around so I helped her off and she went to explore the pasture and look at flowers. Not going to let a perfectly good saddle go to waste I hopped onto BoBo and enjoyed a nice seat.

Tired, Hannah fell asleep before we got home even though she knew we were heading out to the pool. She is sleeping as I write this. After she wakes up we will grab our pool things, pack up some PB&J sandwiches and other snacks for dinner and head over to the pool at the fitness center. She doesn&#8217;t know it but she will treat me to some frozen yogurt after pool time.

Despite my favorite person being so far away Father&#8217;s Day has made me happy.
