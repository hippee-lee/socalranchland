The past weekend was busy but more normal than any of the preceding twelve or so. Here is the list of things I did ðŸ™‚<!--more-->

  * Yard work that forced me to charge up the trimmer and mower and buy a hedge trimmer.
  * Removed two plants that were overgrown and in the way. One will need to be replaced with a rock bed thing because it was under the oustide faucet.
  * Fixed the entry door lock. Expensive locks are a pain to install or when the door is not drilled straight it is a pain to install the locks. I&#8217;m not sure which one applies to me but when the new front door lock set we got was assembled the latch pice was getting warped and making it difficult to open properly from the inside.
  * Single track &#8211; I got my bike out and put some air in the tires. It needs some tlc &#8211; brakes are squeaking and the rear detailer is not moving properly up and down the ring. I hit up the trail right by home and boy was it nice to have a trail less than a mile from the garage!
  * Garage organization &#8211; chaos and order are two ever changing states. Randomly moving things around the garage has helped me organize things that are loosely related and group them together.
  * I saw a coyote on a trial run Saturday morning. He didn&#8217;t hear me until I spoke to him.
  * Thought about the performance issues impacting the d/encryption of PII in my iOS app. I think the UIScrollViewDelegate is the path forward.

  With date night at the movies on Saturday (The latest Bourne movie) it felt closer to what a normal weekend is to me.
