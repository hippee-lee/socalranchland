I finished the Doodle Revolution book this morning by Sunni Brown. Overall it taught me that questions are about systems, processes or comparisons (sometimes comparing one system or process to another). These questions lead to meetings with communication, understanding (or lack thereof) and ideas. The addition of those three things lead to answers.
