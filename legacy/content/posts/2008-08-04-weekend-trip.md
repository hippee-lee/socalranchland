We went to San Diego this weekend and Hannah had a blast. I think it wore her out a little bit though. She got to meed Scott and Sarah&#8217;s new puppy, Aggie and she got to see her Grandma Cheryle and Grandpa Paul while Julie and I went to a wedding. She had a great time with her grandparents and then On Sunday we took her to the San Diego Cove. By then, I think she was grateful for any sleep so she napped most of the time.

The wedding was very nice and it was a lot of fun to be out with Julie. Had a great time.
  
Things to try and get done this week:

  * Patio bricks need more sand and a bit of leveling
  * move dirt &#8211; get ready to put in a fence
  * return tools to Mike (wheelbarrow) and Robert (level)
  * ride out and back from the Gold Hill Trail head (Sunday am)
