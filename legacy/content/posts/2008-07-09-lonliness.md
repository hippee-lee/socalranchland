Oh Hannah, you were so lonely last night. It broke my heart when I went into your room and you were sitting there looking at the little turtle lights and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I got the diaper situation in line and then rocked you back to sleep. It took a few position changes on your part, but we got you comfortable. Then, after you fell asleep, I held you a little longer so I could listen to the tiny snore that was coming from your cute little button nose.

My little kiddo is getting bigger, but not so big just yet.

I am really not a fan of riding a bike on the road, even commuter riding. Although, i was thinking today when I rode in that if I could ride three days a week that would save almost 120 miles of driving per week or:

6000 miles per year (assuming my company keeps us at only two weeks of vacation a year)

20 less fill ups for the Murano

$1350 less on gas per year

a lower resting heart rate

Yesterday I saw five or six bannan peels on the side of the road when I was riding in, today they were all gone.<!--more--> Did animals eat them?
