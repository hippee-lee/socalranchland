I think Hannah is trying to &#8216;train&#8217; us ðŸ™‚

Last night when I was putting her to bed she was fine if I held her, fine if I was giving here a little baby massage while lying in her crib on her side; but not fine if I stepped out of the room. I went to get something from the laundry room and she immediatly started crying. As soon as I came back into the room she stopped, but only for a second and then got louder.

It only took about ten minutes to relax her enough so that she was lulled into light sleep. I was able to slip out of the room then. I decided to give her five minutes to work things out for herself. She cried out a few times, each time getting softer and then sullenly went back to sleep. She stayed asleep until 1:30 or so when Julie took put her back down. Then she didn&#8217;t wake us until 7:00am.

The dogs are still smarter than me, yesterday they got out of the yard and ran around the neighborhood like crazy boxers.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ I got the other doggy fence from the basement and put it up so they<!--more--> can&#8217;t dig out of the yard. How do you stop a boxer from digging? I am smarter than my dogs, I am smarter than my dogs.
