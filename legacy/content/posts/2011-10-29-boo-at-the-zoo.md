We went to the zoo this morning for the annual trick-or-treat session. It was a little crazy with amostt 20 people and over half of us kiddos. This doesn&#8217;t count grown up kiddos, only kiddos of legal age. 

There were a few dramatic moments but overall thhings went pretty smoothly and we stopped at Cinzetti&#8217;s Resturaunt for lunch. There is no better place to go with 10+ hungery, sugar overloaded kiddos. You get your food quickly and there is ample room for a large group. Oddly, things like this were not important to me until I became a parental figure myself.
