There really is an M-x do-anything functionality built into emacs. I am building a form for a client and for some reason the select code they supplied has year options starting at 1920 and ending at 2009. SInce I highly doubt that we get many people who will choose 1920 through the site and because I don&#8217;t want to annoy users who choose the most recent years I figured I would reverse the order, if I caould find M-x functionality that would let me do it fast. Yea M-x Reverse-region ðŸ™‚
