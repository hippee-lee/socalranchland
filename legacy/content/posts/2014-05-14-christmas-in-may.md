#### Optional Titles: Best Wife Ever or Best Present Ever

I am lucky that my wife knows me. After almost a decade of working with her on our relationship I should not be that surprised. But there I was Christmas morning with an envelope that had a print out from TicketMaster. The first thing through my head was wtf. The second thing, since I knew about the concert and given that it was in the heart of Los Angeles I knew it would be impossible to get a piar of tickets, was how did she ???<!--more-->

Doesn&#8217;t matter how. The best thing about my girl is an ability to surprise and delight. All I can try is to give back the same. I know the Maynard genre of music isn&#8217;t at the top of her list but, she enjoys it on my behalf. This is how I ended up at a once in a lifetime concert under a gorgeous moon at the Greek Theater with five bands and three hours of beauteous sonic vibration to enjoy with my best friend. Failure, APC and Puscifer was exciting to begin with. The surprise appearances of Green Jello and Tool were enough to make me giddy like a child, giddy like I was at my first Mushroomhead show back in Cleveland in the early ninties or the rock and roll show I ever went to.

There are moments in time that are precious, unique that will never scale, not even in a digital age. These are the things that ultimately matter the most to me. These are the things I would pass on to an archive to be mined by my grandchildren grandchildren.
