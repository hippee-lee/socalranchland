I&#8217;m not sure why but you are having trouble sleeping. For the last few weeks uyu wont let yourself go to sleep at bedtime. Strange. I wonder if its cause of the long days and late sunsets?

As much trouble it is, i don&#8217;t mind tonight because you are sleeping on my lap and i get some num num snuggles with you, like we used to have when you were really small and i put you to sleep.

In other news, you are moving up to the next phase at Primrose. They are doing a gradual transition and you will start your first full day on friday. Momma Is excited because you will be with Shaye Grote now.
