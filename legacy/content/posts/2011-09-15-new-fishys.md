Hannah helped me pick out some new fish last night. Mr. Fishy died a few weeks ago when the tank had an oxygenation issue. 

Since it was book club night Hannah and I had Mac n&#8217; Cheese and then went to the pet store. She looked at all the fish but was more interested in the cats. She didn&#8217;t want to choose I guided her into the Black Mollies and the Neon Tetras. We can go get some more Neon Tetras in a week or two once the bacteria levels in the tank adjust.
