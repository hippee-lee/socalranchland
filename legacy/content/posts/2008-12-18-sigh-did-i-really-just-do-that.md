I just accidentally moved all images out of the blog folders and then deleted them when I thought they were test data. Crap. Why did I just do that? I guess I should have created real test data for my shell script to work on. üôÅ

Update: yay for upgrades and backups. When upgrading to the latest wp software I realized that I had backups of the image folders and was able to replace them from my backup directory. I think I got all of them back. THere might be a few form December missing that were not backed up yet. Ok, Back to the script I was working on last week.
