Lets get ready for the new year and start with this blog. We start by cleaning out all the old cobwebs in the corners and strip the structure down to its framework. Just the bare skeleton for now. Thats easy and I can do it in a few minutes with AM coffee. WHile I still like the old theme, it was purchased from ThemeForest over two years ago and it is showing its age in web years. I had fun tweaking it just enough to make it do what I wanted it to do. But it is time to start fresh with some of the good things brought to the web in recent times. Starting fresh does not mean starting from a blank page so I am going to use the excellent [wp-bootstrap](http://320press.com/wpbs/ "320 Press: WP-Bootstrap Template") template and rebuild from there in 2013.

Here is my 2013 list of big things to accomplish:

  1. Return focus to my personal site 
      * Add more long form posts, sketches and favorite prime photos
      * Modify the new template to include the images in a functional way and clean up the Tags and Â Categories.
      * Review old drafts and either get rid of them or publish them.
  2. Write and publish a useful and free iOS app in the app store
  3. 180 & Core
  4. Backcountry hunting with a camera &#8211; Mt. Baldy and the spring corn in the Sierra Nevadas
  5. Hit the Sycamore Cyn and Lizard Rock trail systems at least once a month
