I took the scholarship test for the main frame admin classes at DU. Holy crap! I am a little fuzzy on the things we learned in school. I&#8217;ll need to review the areas of discrete math, networking, JAVA AND C/C++ .

It might be best to start a computing sub category where I can go over each problem in more detail and address what I have forgotten
