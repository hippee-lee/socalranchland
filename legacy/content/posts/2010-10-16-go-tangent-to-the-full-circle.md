I remember the first time I downloaded python and did something with it. I don&#8217;t remember exactly what it was but I recall setting up a loop and calculating something for a long list of numbers, data collected in the lab. It was fun and got me my answer quickly and I did not have to muddle through the confusing Excel interface to find the function that would do what I wanted.
  
The next week I started working on my comp. sci. degree and got distracted by many things.
  
I now go back to python to scratch my itch. I want to work on interesting problems, i screened the prospectives and tried to choose wisely. While I like working with html, writing it like it&#8217;s 1999 is not my idea of an interesting problem to solve.
  
Obvioulsy my coding skills are not good enough to solve some of the more important problems that no one has time to work on but I can change that.
  
This is to say that I want to see how far it can go and just how much I can do. So here&#8217;s to you python, seven years after I discovered you we meet again.
