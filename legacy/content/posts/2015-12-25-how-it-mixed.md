Hannah was helping me make frosting today and I tried to get her to use the mixer. Because, you and I know it&#8217;s faster. She kept saying no so, hey it xmas eve and there is no hurry.&nbsp;

I probed a bit because it was obvious to me that the matchine was faster and more efficient at mixing the food coloring into the frosting. &#8220;It does it to fast she said. I want to watch it mix.&#8221; &nbsp;

Huh.&nbsp;

It does it to fast and it&#8217;s fun to watch the food coloring mix into the white frosting. What a reminder to be fascinated by the little things. An example of how faster isn&#8217;t always better because the mixer blends so fast I was missing out on the streaks of white and color that spiraled in. The gradients in the color as darker and lighter parts average into a smooth shade of green.&nbsp;

I may be the teacher but I have much to learn. She (re)taught me that in order to better understand something you need to slow it down so you can better study it. You need to connect with it in order to understand and perhaps even manipulate it. Animation is like this.

I was proud though, she did get her mom to &#8216;help&#8217; her mix one of them and she did one by herself.
