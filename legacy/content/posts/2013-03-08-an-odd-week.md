After six months of iOS, I went back to the web. Liked the client side, but could have done without the php. Colds and coughs tore through school and us by extension. Ah, it makes us stronger, like a good workout. 

When we moved I found a bunch of journal entries I made over the years. It&#8217;s interesting. There is a lot of silly things. Although I&#8217;m putting this online in 2012, I&#8217;m putting the original publish date when it was written.
