It must be getting close to spring. Riding conditions were not ideal this morning. The Cirque was crusty and icy in places. Not at all like after a fresh snowfall. I hikes it once and then did a few groomer runs but carving was hard; there were to many people to carry speed through the turns safely. 

Last week I watched some of re Mammoth videos from after their monster storm last month. I think that&#8217;s what is causing the greener grass symptoms or why I was missing lift accesible alpine slopes. I don&#8217;t know, maybe I should try to talk Julie into taking a weeks vacation out there next year? 

I found a place that sells split boards. The package includes board, hardware and skins. I think I would like the 166cm ride but want to go talk to them first. 

Maybe it has warmed up enough, I am going to go check out the half pipe.
