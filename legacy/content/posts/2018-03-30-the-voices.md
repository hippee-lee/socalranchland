I am struggling to get back into my morning routine. Even though I know its good for me its been a struggle for the past few weeks to get up and get going. Part of it is me. I am a creature of habit and routine. Get me off my routine and it seems like everything has fundamentally changed and it takes cycles to get back on.

Maybe telling myself that I will do it is enough. We shall see.
  
Hey Matt, you will get back into your early morning routine tomorrow and report back here in a week.
