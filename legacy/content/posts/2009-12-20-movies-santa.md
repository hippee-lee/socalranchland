Julie took Hannah to her first theater movie: The Princess and the Frog. 

Later, she had a really funny comment in the car on the way to ride Bobo. Julie had given her the chapstick to use and H wouldn&#8217;t give it back. We had to stop the car to take it from her. Julie explaind that the chapstick was hers and H couldn&#8217;t keep it. H was very upset so i said, 

&#8216;Hannah, if you are good Santa may bring you your own chapstick on christmas.&#8217;
  
To which she replied, &#8216;Hannah loves Santa.&#8217; She had a very pouty look on her face when she said it. 

Then she rode Bobo with me and we chased Julie around the arena.

Tomorrow, Mama Rosa and Papa Rosa will get her from Ohio and we will leave for Uncle Rob and Aunt Katie&#8217;s house in Montana.
