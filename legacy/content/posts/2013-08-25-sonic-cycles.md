In life, everything is tied to a cycle, a rhythm and the beat of someones drum. Things pulse and we are drawn to them in unison. Be it music, be it it code (hardware & software) be it a summer festival in the sun. We are all drawn to the light.

For me, music is the light and  I&#8217;m just a fan of anything good. I grew up in northeastern Ohio with the heavy metal hard rock that was really, really fun in the nineties along the Cuyahoga River. Then, Lake Erie and the flats were a great place to experience music and pure Rock & Roll. And then Lallapalooza &#8217;91 came into town and blew my mind. It expand all of the possibilities to the next level that led me to where I am today.

<!--more-->Looking back, there was a rich history of pop , rock, metal, funk and techno to dive into. Then, when the ecosystem changed an a digitally forced evolution changed everything I had the foundation to continue to keep on experiencing sonic nirvana. It&#8217;s been fun. It&#8217;s made me realize that good music will always rise above genres, charts and top 40 analysts. People will always search for and find  something that connects &#8211; to a place, to a time to a group of like minded individuals.

Given that I believe that  we all want to connect to a common thread &#8211; there is a sonic revolution coming. I hear it it the #nin2013 tour online and I anticipate it in the optimistically hopeful next Tool album that will make great noise and dramatic visual candy.

Right now it feels very late 70&#8217;s, very funky and groovy. Cool. I like it. But, I can&#8217;t wait for that Nirvana on Saturday Night Live moment when I understand that things have changed and Hard Rock, same as the old Rock &#8211; is back in town.

To me, all music is rock-n-roll. If its got a good beat and a catchy lyric &#8211; i&#8217;ll buy. But, I truly, I deeply, love whah whah driven, phase shifted screaming raw vocals with a syncopated drum line that epitomizes rock-and-roll as I have experienced it. It&#8217;s coming back around again. I hear it and it won&#8217;t be on your radio.
