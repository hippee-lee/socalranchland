Hmm, last night was an interesting night. You would NOT go down for momma, even when she took you to bed with her. I took over around 10:30 or so and we sat in the rocking chair in the corner of your room. Last week I put a night light in there so that you don&#8217;t wake up in a total black out. Last night you discovered light and shodows. For almost thirty minutes you watched me make one handed shadow puppets and move my head around. Then, I tried to get you to do them. after a few minutes of me holding your arm out into the light you started to move it around. I think you made the connection beteen the movement of your arm and the movement of the shadow on the ceiling.

You also like to be talked to. You were interested in the shadows on the ceiling so I told you all about what we were doing with the shadows (making one handed puppets); then, when you started rubbing your eyes I started talking you down to sleep. I told you about the geometry of trees (really all plants). How the branches off the main stem can<!--more--> be measured in terms of angles and rotation. When you finally put your head on my shoulder and went under a little bit, I switched to a softer voice and mumbled stuff about sleep stages and elves. After I put you down in your crib you stll wanted some company so I massaged your back for a little bit and you seemed to like that. It helped you go back to sleep. Once you were snoring I slipped out of the room.
