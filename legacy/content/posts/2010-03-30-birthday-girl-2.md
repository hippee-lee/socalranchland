This morning Hannah woke Julie up with the birthday card she colored for her. 

it was a sunny almost 80 degree spring day. Hannah did soccer at Primrose and then we made cup cakes while we waited for Liu&#8217;s take out to arrive. 

Hannah needed a bath after helping Julie clean up the cake batter bowl.
