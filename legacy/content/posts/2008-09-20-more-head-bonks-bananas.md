Hannah got another head Bonk this morning. She was walking around the bedroom while I was washing my face and ran into a corner. Her favorite food seems to be bananas (coincidence?). She hasn&#8217;t given me any new signs lately but I am still giving her more, eat, mamma, pappa, dog, kitty and horse. Julie has been working with her object identification: where is the kitty? Where&#8217;s papa, etc for most of those signs.
