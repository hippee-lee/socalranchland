I walked far today. Well, not really far but farther than I usually do. I usually prefer to ride things. Standing is easy, walking is not hard but its harder than standing.

We took the dogs to a creek and Hannah rode in the stroller. I hope she feels better soon.

For my afternoon walk I stayed close in the neighborhood and walked around there for a few hours on a home improvement project. The home is looking improved I would have to say. And, I can enjoy taking a load off my tired feet &#8211; they earned it today.

The plan for tomorrow is to only stand. There might be a mile or two of hiking involved but after that just stand up and go down the slope. With the warm weather I wonder if there will be any spring corn in the alphabet chutes.
