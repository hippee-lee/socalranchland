The next user interface will combine motion with action. Most of the &#8216;action&#8217; will be spoken in the way an executive gives orders to the minions. Copy this, save that and put the other thing over there, oh yeah, when I finish this, remind me to do the other thing before I get distracted by shinty Internet things. All desired actions will Â be spoken aloud in conversation. You know people like me whom in the middle of a problem talk it through. Yeah, these additions to ourinterface will be great for us. ðŸ™‚<!--more-->

The motion will be intricate: it will help you enhance the details and put the polish on your finished product. Instead of tap, tap, tapping your way to consumption of Internet media as we do with &#8216;touch&#8217; actions. You will caress the details into brilliant messages with the style and elegance used by master craftsman for hundreds of years to produce real things in the world.

The future is me, telling my computer to set up a new blog post; with my voice while I am running and then dictating the words while I continue to jog around the park I will create when I am most creative, when the creative stream washes ashore. When I get home I will tell the computer to read my draft. While the draft is read back I will stop it, edit it and massage the message to be clear: &#8216;delete the last sentence&#8217;, &#8216;replace it with this one&#8217; and then change all phrases with &#8216;for realz&#8217; to &#8216;go sho.&#8217;

We all multi task ( albeit poorly since even with advanced chips there is no way to do two things at once and your computer is just better at hiding it from you than your employees are ). While I am in the listen, edit and revise mode of creating content I am also using the Leap Motion inspired interface to dig through my photo library to find the best images to enhance my creation.

Hmmm is there a modern repl (read eval print loop) concept for the new visual interfaces? cesl? Create, edit, show & loop &#8211; could make for great power with a direct andive feedbsck mechanism integrated to it. Is there something wrong with that analogy all together?

When it&#8217;s ready I just tell the computer it&#8217;s ready and the computer knows to push it to my longer form writing channel. In the future, we will tell our computers what to do while we are tapping, swiping, and grabbing our content and creations with both hands in mid air between our minds and our monitors.
