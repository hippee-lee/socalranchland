      <description>Last night was Halloween. Hannah was a Ladybug, and a very cute one at that.
She was a little funny at the Halloween party. I am not sure if it is because she fell off Bobo (Totally her parental units fault), the lack of a nap or something else. At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&amp;#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her.</description>
