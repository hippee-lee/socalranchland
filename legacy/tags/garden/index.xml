      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got back from Copper Mtn yesterdayaround 2:30 and still had time to got to The Tree Farm and get plants for landscaping the new bed in front of the deck. After some discussion and digging in the ~100 degree sunshine (after riding 80 miles the day before!!!) Julie put in three rows of plants while Hannah (finally) napped:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasses in back, next to the railing &amp;#8211; should grow to ~3-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barberry plants &amp;#8211; should grow 2-3 feet tall and 3-4 feet wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty white flowers (I forget the name) &amp;#8211; should grow to ~1-1.5 feet wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the sprinklers. The rose bed next to he house has 4 drip lines and I think that will work nicely there but it isn&amp;#8217;t planted yet. The garden has three adjustable 360 degree arc sprays with a 5 foot diameter. The nice thing about them is that with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch line they can be moved to suit my watering needs. The bed next to the steps has two, 180 degree arcs with an eight foot radius; but, I think I am going to swap them for five foot diameter that have a 360 spray arc with longer &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch connector&lt;/p&gt;</description>
