      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not the algorithmic kind, the real kind. The kind of sorting that was around long before even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism&#34;&gt;first computer&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, perhaps I had some coins. Coins used to be a popular way to facilitate exchanges. So there we were back when this ancient computer was built. But we didn&amp;#8217;t care about Â the computer. I had coins, you had beans, lets talk and make an exchange. Being competitive, I wanted as many of your beans for as few of my coins as possible. And thats where sorting comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
