      <title>Eyes Closed and Sitting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit here and try to see what it is that I want I see hazy unfocused shapes moving around in a milky white fog. What is it I need to do and how do I want to get that done? There is more than just the gears behind the clock face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes quite a bit of time to put the shortest bit of delight together. Delight that is fleeting only because of the amount of thought and attention to detail that went into it. Take &lt;a href=&#34;http://hippeelee.com/julie/vday&#34;&gt;cards&lt;/a&gt; for example. No matter where they are found there is far more time in preparing them for consumption that the actual consumption which could only be a few seconds. They comunicate ideas and emotions simply (at least my favorite ones do) and they do it with extreme efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the last card you gave. Most likely, you picked it up at a store, signed your name to it and sent it on its way. Perhaps you took the time to write a more personal note. All of the hard stuff was done for you: which card stock to use, how many colors to use in the graphic design on the front in inside,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Child Shapes</title>

      <description>Here is my vision for the css3zen design. The theme is simple child shapes, blocks, circles, triangles and rectangles &amp;#8211; The first shapes that Hannah recognized. Since there is a child element we will keep the colors to primary (but you can use transparency if needed).
The layout will be simple, blocky and make use of whitespace. The imagry will incorporate the shapes theme and I&amp;#8217;ll use gimp to create them.</description>

      <title>It&amp;#8217;s Complicated</title>

      <description>I received a 32 page power point presentation for a simple how-to do something in a web application. If it takes 32 steps to do something (simple) then the application is to complicated.</description>
