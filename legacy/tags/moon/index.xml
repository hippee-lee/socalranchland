      <description>I&amp;#8217;m impressed, iPhoto&amp;#8217;s facial recognition software can also id the moon. I mean, I have always known that there was a man on the moon and that when it was full there was an eye and nose that are clearly visible so I guess it would be a good training object.Is This The Moon?</description>
