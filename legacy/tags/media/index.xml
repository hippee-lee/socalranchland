&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%%slide=3%%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my favorite person being in Puerto Rico swimming with giant sea turtles and diving in warm, clear water &amp;#8211; it has been a great Father&amp;#8217;s Day. I prefer to be called Papa but what I prefer and what She Who Matters prefers are often two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to sleep in until after 7am. That was not as late as I would have preferred but later than I thought my actual wake up call would be. We ate a simple breakfast and then trailered up the Marin cruising bike. We rode with the dogs up by Sheridan Parkway and then down around the Community Center. We ended up back where we started with two tired and thirsty boxers and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we went to the stores we stopped by the neighborhood drug dealer. I got a coffee and Hannah go Hello Kitty Fruit Juice from 7-11. Then we made three stops. We got a lazer engraved name tag for KeeKee &amp;#8211; the engraving process was pretty cool I told Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later she asked me, &amp;#8220;Daddy, what is cool?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her &amp;#8220;Cool is something fun to do or be with, like a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then my friends are cool.&amp;#8221; She said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we got&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to myself. Using the bluehost site backup tools did not go as expected. One minute there were 300+ public posts the next day there were 72. Weird I thought. I am happy that I did a manual dump last month. Here are the steps I took to restore my content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the remaning blog posts with the export function from my wp-admin export page. Lucky for me the sites small and I can just export everything and still get a reasonably sized file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From my laptop:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scp last-months-database-backup.sql to my bluehost account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into bluehost command line and run the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mysqldump -u -p dbname wp_users &amp;gt; wp-users.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the command line mysql client: mysql -u -p dbname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: use dbname&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: source last-months-database-backup.sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the mysql command line client: source wp-users.sql (I think there was a confilct when I did step #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the website admin import area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the wprdpress admin import function select the file created in step #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be happy I can do this for myself ðŸ™‚&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its Time to write my own script that I can run from my laptop. Here is what I&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was looking for something to watch on netflix tonight and came accross the following category:

Up until now I have been unaware of the &amp;#8220;Feel Good Good Talking Animal TV Shows&amp;#8221; Genre. Finding it made me smile.
I really like the Pingu animations. I like to watch them with Hannah because she really gets why it&amp;#8217;s funny. I have never seen someone focus so intently as she does.</description>
