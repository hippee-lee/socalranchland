      <description>A minor rant on the inability of large companies to meet my needs. I understand that they do everything for the average customer and that really means the numbers that the MBA&amp;#8217;s and finance geeks tell them are important. There is no real person who is the average home depot customer and that means the individuals get passed over in the end. Thats fine, I understand that they have to keep the shareholdes happy.</description>
