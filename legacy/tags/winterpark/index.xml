      <description>It was most certainly out of the ordinary. And she wanted to go faster while yelling at me to let her do it on her own ðŸ™‚
It was almost as much work as riding the park and the pipe or carving out heelside turns that compliment the toeside. It was more fun than I have ever had on the slopes and I returned home a very proud papa.
At least equal to being hip deep in powder on a double black diamond above the treeline and more fulfilling than turning my first frontside 360.</description>
