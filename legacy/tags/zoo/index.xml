      <description>We went to the zoo this morning for the annual trick-or-treat session. It was a little crazy with amostt 20 people and over half of us kiddos. This doesn&amp;#8217;t count grown up kiddos, only kiddos of legal age.
There were a few dramatic moments but overall thhings went pretty smoothly and we stopped at Cinzetti&amp;#8217;s Resturaunt for lunch. There is no better place to go with 10+ hungery, sugar overloaded kiddos.</description>
