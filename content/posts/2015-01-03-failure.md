No, not [the band](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_%28band%29). But I do hope they put a new album out this year.

Failure as in, &#8216;define my success by the things I have failed trying to do.&#8217;

Failure as in, &#8216;if I have not failed at something today, then I&#8217;m not challenging myself.&#8217;

Failure as is, &#8216;we grow and learn the most when we struggle and fail to easily succeed at something.&#8217;

Forget failing fast. Just try many things and plan to fail at most of them. Pick one to focus on and better understand why failure occurred.
