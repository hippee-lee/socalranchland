I tricked Hannah into going to her room friday night. She started out in my bed with mama and then i took her into her crib when i went to bed. It helped to hold her on my shoulder until she was uncomfortable and wanted to go to sleep. Then i asked her if she wanted to lie down in her crib. She said yes and was snuggling down, back to sleep in a few minutes.
