if Mt St. Helens ever went cold enough for snow to collect it looks like a great back country bowl to ride. 

I am watching NOVA and it infotms me that it erupted in 2007 but it was nore of a fizzle. then the seismic activity went quit. Cool. 

it was warm today. Sunny with strong winds out of the north.
