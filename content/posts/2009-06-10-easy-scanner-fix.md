Remember, if you are just getting started with a mac, or any operating system, right click everything. Chances are you will get a contect menu with relevent operations for the object that you right clicked on.

Here is what I went over with Dad last Sunday (Yuuguu is the most helpful screen sharing app):

  1. Command + a =Ã‚Â select all. This applies to files in the finder when you are viewing a folder, the desktop, pictures in iPhoto and even the text in a writtne document.
  2. If you hardware (scanner / printer) has an issue try unplugging it and then plugging it back in before you look at anything else. Worst case scenario, use the System Preferences/Print & Fax pane and uninstall/reinstall your printer software.
  3. Dad&#8217;s intro to spotlight. After we &#8216;fixed&#8217; the scanner he tested it to make sure it worked but he didn&#8217;t choose the right folder to save the scanned image in. Since he roughly remembered the name he used I directed him to the little magnifying glass in the top right hand corner of his screen. Dad, meet Spotlight. He typed in the name he remembered and there it was in the drop down list. I told him to click<!--more--> on it. You can also access the Spotlight search from the Finder. In fact it might be easier for a beginner to use since it will show you the path to your missing file after you click on it.

  4. Organizing files on the desktop. First minimize or use Expose to clear all windows from the screen so you can see the desktop. Then make sure focus is on the desktop by clicking anywhere on it andÃ‚Â select all files (Command + a). Now you can use the view menu to organize the files/folders on you desktop as you wish. TO get started I recommend selecting all, View/Keep Arranged By/Name to put them in alphabetical order.
