From [Anatidae&#8217;s comment](http://disq.us/8iz8d5) on the web:

>   * <span style="color: #3f4549;">If you&#8217;re messing with the DOM, do it in a directive</span>
>   * <span style="color: #3f4549;">If you&#8217;re modifying your data, do it in your controllers or services. </span>
>   * <span style="color: #3f4549;">If you&#8217;re defining data, do it in a factory.</span>

Also, the faster you forget about jQuery, the faster you will be productive building an Angular app. You can always bring it back later if you still want to and you may run into in in disguise in one of your directives.
