\*\*UPDATE2\*\* boulderwindshields.com was great, they showed up early at my work location and had it filled in about ten minutes. you can still see where the chip was, barely. Hopefully it won&#8217;t crack any further. 

\*\*UPDATE\*\* boulderwindshields.com looks promising: $59.95 for the first chip. $30 better than the online quote J got. I filled out their contact form and am waiting to hear back from them.Ã‚Â 

Julie found an online quote of $99 to repair a windshield chip in the Murano. BeforeÃ‚Â committingÃ‚Â I want to callaround and see what offline prices are:
