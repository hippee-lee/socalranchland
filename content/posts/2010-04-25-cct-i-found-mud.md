i started at the parking lot of my new job. behind the parking lot, there was a trail. i wanted to see where it came out. it exits on 119th and that means i can easily ride to work. 

it was partly sunny and cool, around 60 degrees, but windy; so i rode up the the coal creek trail and took that until it ended up behind a golf course. along the way there was quite a bit of mud. the creek is running high and parts of it were overflowing the trail. 

for more challange it will be better to drive over to highyway 93 and park there.
