I am amazed at how long I went with out installing js2-mode on the netbook. To make it easy, I used the emacs default kit for saner defaults. Seems to work nicely. 

I haven&#8217;t been back to the orc battle since Christmas. I have been coding with the ruby koans and a fun little js project I am calling ticker. The idea is to use only pure js to make elements on a page tick, like a digital clock ticks its nuimbers away. So I put some images into a div and the object finds them. Then it starts with a default show but also offers the user the ability to navigate the slide show if they want to.y ticker object and its hide/show methods work on the images it finds on load. The next thing to do will to write a snow\_next\_image function. 

At the gym I found a good hold in the crack about 2/3&#8217;s of the way up. Finally got the unmarked route that was set before all the old staff left. They made a new yellow one on the right side of the crack that makes me lean back at the top.
