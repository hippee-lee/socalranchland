Labor Day is for doing labor, right? Anywho, I re-did the side to make it look less getto and to stop Mr. Gurgi from esacaping. Alas, when we did a test run by taking Hannah to the pool, one last time before summer ends, he escaped and was in the back yard! Julie thinks he jumped on the dog house and then jumped the fence and that&#8217;s why he couldn&#8217;t get back over.
