Oh cool! On my way home today I got an email telling me that I got one of the scholarships for the mainframe administration certification at DU. The test was hard, it touched on concepts that are hazy memories from school four years ago. I may have to go back and do a bit of review so I can touch up on those concepts. 

From what i can read about the last class It looks like I&#8217;ll be spending alot of time on the command line this spring. The slides I found from last semester mention vi. I hope i can sed &#8216;s/vi/emacs/&#8217;. 

The course description of the mainframe class indicates it may be a bit more c/c++ or perl/python than I have done ever. Interesting. 

I am looking forward to it, it should be educational.
