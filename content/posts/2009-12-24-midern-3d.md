Anticipating the Avatar movie. i hope it lives up to the marketing.

Hannah is making cookies with MamaRosa and PapaRosa at the Macks and Santa is on his way. its her second xmas and i think she kinda gets it. Tommorow should be fun.

Good story, awesome effects. The 3d was really cool but not the whole movie. Enjoyed the story and got some ideas for my own. If I can&#8217;t find a decent employer this year, maybe I can write a decent story of my own.
