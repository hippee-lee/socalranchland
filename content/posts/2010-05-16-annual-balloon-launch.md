Busy is the word of the day.
  
Up at six to see the balloons. A great spring morning. After brunch I pushed the mower around the yard. I think Julie is right about the backyard. I will be interested in what they propose. 

We met Erica and Jeff in Denver for the rocky&#8217;s game. Hannah was pretty tolerant of all the running around. We got home early and Julie was not feeling well. 

Hannah and I played with play doh, watched the first half of Finding Nemo. She had pb&j with a side of jello. Then we pushed strollers before going upstairs. 

We brushed her teeth and read books. She is getting more proactive in her reading and taking the lead.
