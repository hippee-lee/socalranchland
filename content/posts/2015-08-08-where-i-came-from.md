You can never escape your past and sometimes it gives you a happy return. Hannah found an old Ohio flag in my closet. I think it&#8217;s from college but can&#8217;t be sure.&nbsp;

She had all kinds of questions why did I have it. Where was it from and what was it for and could she hand it up somewhere. When she stopped to take a breath I told her that I thought it was a great idea. This is where she hung it. &nbsp;

On the same old bed that I slept under when I was a child, in Ohio.&nbsp;
