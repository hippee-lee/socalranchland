It was a pretty nice day here yesterday. The temp got up to about 60 degrees and thats unusual for this time of the year. I should have been able to leave the pups at home except for Whitney&#8217;s ear. She had a wart like growth on it that needed to be removed so Julie and I performed some minor surgery. The only problem with it is that it was on her ear and head wounds tend to bleed, alot. As I recall the Clyde and Katie incident from a few years ago, small wounds on ears are notoriously hard to clot. 

Removing the wart was easy, keeping Whitney from shaking her head and re-opening the clot was not so easy. I ended up with the solution you see in the picture. But, after the wound had clotted several times I used New Skin instead of a gauze bandage. This way I could use the ace bandage only and just keep her ear from moving around when she shook her head. We also avoided the need to buy a cone. She wasn&#8217;t able to escape looking a little silly though.
