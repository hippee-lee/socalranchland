I have been looking for an editor that was robust enough to handle a wide range of languages. On any given day I can go from HTML/CSS to JavaScript to PHP. Usually i&#8217;ll stop on the command line for some Bashing. I am looking for something close to emacs in that it can be extended and customized. While there is nothing like emacs (for me) Sublime Text 2 seems to fit the bill. So this week I ponied up and bought a personal license. That taken care of i set to work searching the internets for customization tips.

What I like about it is that like emacs you can customeize in bite size hunks: one thing at a time. This will build up a robust config file I can put into my bitbucket and push and pull my changes from wither my Ubuntu dev server or the MBP I use for dev also.
