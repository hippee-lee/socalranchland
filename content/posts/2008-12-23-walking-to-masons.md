I was carrying you down to Masons house this morning and you almost jumped out of my arms. You really wanted to walk in the snow.

Then, when we got there Mason was already dancing to the radio and you joined right in. I didn&#8217;t even have time to get your coat off.

On my way back I took a picture of your footprints in the snow.
