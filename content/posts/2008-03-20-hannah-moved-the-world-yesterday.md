I was carrying Hannah around and we were looking at stuff in the garage. She has been reaching for things for a few days now and recently she is getting her coordination dialed in. That is, she is getting what she reaches for. I was looking at my mountain bike when she reached out and grabbed a spoke on Julies road bike that is hanging from a hook. As I moved away she kept holding on. The bike moved about six inches and then she let it go. It swung back and forth and, smiling broadly, she watched it swing back and forth in amazement. She seemed to be studying the bikes motion. It was a beautiful thing to watch.

Today I also mended a pair of pants that I like and have had for several years. Using [this tutorial](http://askandyaboutclothes.com/Tutorials/KabbazHowToSewOnABUTTON.htm) I was able to sew the button on with out tying any knots.The pictures are a little grainy but the instructions are clear. Julie laughed at me because of how long I spent focused on one little button.
