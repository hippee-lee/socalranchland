These days I spend more time in Xcode with Objective-C than the web application part of my world. However the API needs to talk to the iOS app so I jump back into that world intermittently. I used to think JavaScript was my strongest language and that PHP was second. 

No more! Today i modified the Objective-C code that interfaces to the API in a fraction of the time it took me to figure out how to change the API for this particular issue. 

It is weird, but cool in a way, to like Objective-C more than the languages I learned to write code with.
