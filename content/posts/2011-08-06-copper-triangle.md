Besides building the split level addition to the deck I have had another summer project. Well, it is not really my project, I am just part of the support team. Julie trained (with Rob and Katie) all spring and summer for the Copper Triangle ride. This morning they all got up at 5am and rode ~80 miles over three mountain passes. Starting at Copper Mtn and finishing with a scenic downhill over Vail Pass they DID IT!. I am very proud.

What does support entail? Lots and lots of Hannah TIme. She helped me build the wall, go to the gym for yoga, mow the lawn and today take pictures and cheer riders on. We did a bit of cheering while waiting to see them ride by before climbing Vail Pass and she also did disagreeing with the situation. See, I thought I lost my wallet thursday and asked to have holds put on my bank card and credit card that I carry in it. Lucky for me A cop was nearby and took it to the property and evidence division in Boulder. Not so lucky for me is that it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to unlock the cards so all<!--more--> I have right now is a debit card and businesses do not seem to want money that way. Wtf &#8211; right? They actually refused my money. This greatly distressed H because we waited in line to ge tthe pink cake/candy/sucker like thing and then I had to tell her no and that we had to wait for a snack.

More and more, it seems to me the old businesses just do not meet my expectations. In fact, I have a very long post in the works about my long, frustrating experience with AMEX. I don&#8217;t want to color this post with that nonsense and despite her disappointment H kept me on my toes and I think we had fun. I say that I think because she did alot of yelling at me and oscillated between super cold (Daddy I just want Mama) and warm (Daddy you are my friend and I like playing word rhyme games with you). Thats normal for someone who is almost four right? It gets easier when she is a teenager and I can just take her on mountain biking with me &#8211; right? Right. Anyway, even though she has been a cross between cranky but and best friend I have had fun spending time with her. Here are some of the pictures from today.



Last semi-random thought not at all related to this weekend. I&#8217;m putting it here for now because I dont want to forget it. I have heard several folks talk about the debt ceiling issue that just passed. Specifically I have heard several people say that this was congresses finest hour because they all went home unhappy but came together to compromise on a very important project. I find the &#8216;finest hour&#8217; spin a bit hard to swallow &#8211; if the only time our elected body can compromise is the last minute on an<del>issue</del> artificially created crisis that has the potential to destabilize the world&#8217;s economy then how can we trust them to get the ordinary, mundane but important things done? Also, can one truly claim that they do their best work when they wait until the last minute to work on the problem? I guess I want to know why they didn&#8217;t have this done a month before the deadline, it&#8217;s not like they didn&#8217;t know it was coming. Are they really that lazy or just so driven by ideology instead of practicality that they have forgotten the faces of the people they represent &#8211; even the people they represent that they disagree with. I don&#8217;t know anymore about politics. I am glad to be an independent but wish that I could get represented (I.E I want to vote for the best candidate from the primary&#8217;s through the general election no matter what <del>fraternity </del>political party they belong to.
