I had an interesting conversation with Hannah last night. When i went back into her room she was sitting on the rocker with some books.

She told me that she was sitting on her rocker reading but we could share it. I asked her what she wanted and found out that she likes to play with her friend mommy and she likes green eggs and ham. She also has two friends at school, Shaye and Emma.

We read some books.

This morning, got out the door early and explored the trails over by 128 and 93. Good beginner and intermediate levels and a fun loop. Loops are fun because you never take the same line twice even though its the same trail.
