No tooth for Hannah yet. She was really happy this morning though and is still drooling like a mad baby and I am pretty sure that she does not have rabies. That means she is still getting closer to popping that first tooth. SHe is eating pretty well now, she really likes fruit. Julie told me that she ate the whole serving of bananas this morning.Ã‚Â It seems Hannah likes bananas.

I saw the eels show last night. Went with M my neighbor and a group of people. Was a good show at the Fox Theater in Boulder. A little crowded but atmosphere was pretty intimate and he puts on an entertaining show. He played a wide range of selections (old and new) and I found out that he is a really good drummer. Before the show they were playing the DVD that came out with his latest album. I saw that he also has a book so I found it on amazon this morning and placed an order. Should be an interesting read.

It snowed today and I think that will hold up Cheryle and Paul. They stayed in Grand Junction last night and will get here today if there isn&#8217;t<!--more--> to much snow in the high country. Speaking of snow, maybe I can talk Cory into going up to Berthoud Pass this week end and getting some runs?Ã‚Â I expect that Paul and Cheryle will be happy that the weekend is supposed to be upper 60&#8217;s and sunny. I know I am. Hannah has started doing so many things since they last saw her; sitting up (almost on her own, very vocal, grabbing stuff, eating &#8216;real&#8217; baby food.
