Hannah had lots of fun at the Pincrest jump rope for the heart. They she has been using mine because the first one we got her didn&#8217;t work as good as mine. 

Yesterday we picked her out a new one and today she got a second one from school. Attached to it was this plane. She did the assembly all by herself on the ride home from school. Last Sunday I got to show her how the Volvo brakes come apart and go back together. She kept track of the lug it&#8217;s for me by putting Allen wrenches into them. 

I tried to explain to her why they were called Allen wrenches and had to admit that I really didn&#8217;t know. Today she showed me how much she absorbs even when I&#8217;m not paying attention.

She figured out how all the pieces went together and put the stickers on the nose.
