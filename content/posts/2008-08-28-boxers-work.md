I have the side yard (dog run) apart while I fill in the low areas of backfill around the foundation that has sunk. I am also putting a split rail fence, that T&#8217;s off the fenceÃƒâ€šÃ‚ separatingÃƒâ€šÃ‚ our yard form the neighbors house, with a gate to seperate side yard from back yard. I&#8217;ll also need to spread some some cover material that is not river rock. River rock is quite possibly the worst landscaping material I have ever seen or worked with. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ All this means the pups get to come to work with me again today.

In other ToDo news, I need to look at the Murano brake pads as they are getting close to needing replacement. Its a good thing we have a long Labor Day weekend coming up ðŸ™‚
