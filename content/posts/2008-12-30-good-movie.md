J, RK, and L saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tonight. It was a really good movie. Very effective and subtle cg and a good story line. 

I find that post Hannah some movies affect me differently. The scene where BB sits and watches his daughter in the crib was really touching; I think because I have done that with Hannah. There is nothing more magical than watching your daughter sleeping and completely at peace. It is such a contrast to her waking persona that is a blazing ball of energy and excitement and curiosity.
