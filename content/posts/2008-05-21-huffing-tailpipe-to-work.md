I rode into work today to get some extra riding in. Its weird, but when it is colder the air seems fresher or something. This morning and there was lots of tailpipe to smoke. To bad that&#8217;s not what I like to smoke. Anyways, ride stats are as follows:

Trip Distance &#8211; 37.52 miles

Trip Time &#8211; 2:10:39 hours

Average Speed &#8211; 17.23 mph

Max Speed &#8211; 35.80

This weekend I think I&#8217;ll get up a little early and try to get over 60 miles in.

Hannah news: I went in to get her at her usual wakeup time of 5:15 and she was sleeping on her Stomach! That&#8217;s huge for little miss &#8216;I do not like to spend any time on my tummy&#8217; ðŸ™‚ She is also able to stand up for a short time if you lean her against the couch. Yay! I am sure she will want to go snowboarding with us next year ðŸ˜‰ Julei and I have started practicing her crawling coordination. What is that you ask? Well let me tell you. We put Hannah on her back and one of us takes the legs while the other takes the arms. Then we alternate each side in a pseudo crawling motion. It<!--more--> is right leg to left arm and then do the opposite set. She seems to like it for a few minutes but I don&#8217;t think she has let us do it for the whole 10 minutes that we try work her out for. It rather funny cause I think she gets bored. Then she starts extending her legs and arching her back. Her little way of telling us ok that was fun but really, lets move on to something else.

In puppy dog news we found out who was sneaking into the back yard and doing small amounts of damage while we were away. Mr Gurgi was able to pull out the stakes to the fence that seperates the side yard from the back yard and he would spend the day eating the cable coaxal line and puling branches off hte trees. Then, I&#8217;m sure because he knew it was time for us to come home, he would join Whitney back in the side yard looking as innocent as ever. I added more stakes and that seems to have stopped him for now. It also might be the five mile runs we are doing 2-3 times a week on topÃƒâ€šÃ‚ of the nightly walks.
