I was having a weird layout issue with the Bootstrap 3 Grid this morning. After three attempts that ended in failure, on way or the other I was something. Frustrated, pissed, annoyed are words that come close to the feeling, but they are not quite right. English is a funny language and sometimes not quite descriptive enough for the more subtle emotions that wash over you from time to time.

I took a break. On the Twitter I saw the [Virgin twitter feed post](http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/the-quitter) to this. It helped ðŸ™‚

>   When you&#8217;re lost in the Wild, and you&#8217;re scared as a child,<br /> And Death looks you bang in the eye,<br /> And you&#8217;re sore as a boil, it&#8217;s according to Hoyle<br /> To cock your revolver and . . . die.<br /> But the Code of a Man says: &#8220;Fight all you can,&#8221;<br /> And self-dissolution is barred.<br /> In hunger and woe, oh, it&#8217;s easy to blow . . .<br /> It&#8217;s the hell-served-for-breakfast that&#8217;s hard.&#8221;You&#8217;re sick of the game!&#8221; Well, now, that&#8217;s a shame.<br /> You&#8217;re young and you&#8217;re brave and you&#8217;re bright.<br /> &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a raw deal!&#8221; I know â€” but don&#8217;t squeal,<br /> Buck up, do your damnedest, and fight.<br /> It&#8217;s the plugging away that will win you the day,<br /> So don&#8217;t be a piker, old pard!<br /> Just draw on your grit; it&#8217;s so easy to quit:<br /> It&#8217;s the keeping-your-chin-up that&#8217;s hard.It&#8217;s easy to cry that you&#8217;re beaten â€” and die;<br /> It&#8217;s easy to crawfish and crawl;<br /> But to fight and to fight when hope&#8217;s out of sight â€”<br /> Why, that&#8217;s the best game of them all!<br /> And though you come out of each gruelling bout,<br /> All broken and beaten and scarred,<br /> Just have one more try â€” it&#8217;s dead easy to die,<br /> It&#8217;s the keeping-on-living that&#8217;s hard.</p>

    Keep on keeping on constant traveler. Somewhere, sometime, someone has been there before and if they can do it then so can you.
