Great end to my day. 

I ran throughy the nite time books with Hannah. Her two favorites are the Elmo alphabet book and the color and shapes farm animals book. 

Then we said our nite nites. Nite nite list: mama, papa, Gurgi, Whitney, Bella, Bo Bo, mama Rosa, papa Rosa, grandma Cheryle, grandpa Paul, tease, Sierra &#8230;.

Then, after I put her in her crib I did the signs for &#8216;papa love Hannah.&#8217; She got up and said nite nite papa, and blew me a kiss. So I blew her one back and she lay down and snuggled into her soft red &#8216;bankie.&#8217;
