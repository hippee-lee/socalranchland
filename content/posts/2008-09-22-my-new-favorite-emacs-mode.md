Just recently, I learned how to use tramp mode for working on our servers downtown. It could quite possibly be the most useful mode I have discovered in emacs; as far as helping me be more productive at work. It lets me stay in emacs for more things both on my local box and on the servers downtown all at the same time. Yay!Ã‚Â 

Now, If I could only figure out how to get code from the database by function id and then edit it in my local version of emacs and save the changes back to the db. For me, this would eliminate having to copy the function code out of the web browser, paste into a new file in emacs, modify it, paste it back into the browser and save it and then run a test on it to see what I just broke.Ã‚Â 

It is always a good day when you discover a little gem of knowledge.
