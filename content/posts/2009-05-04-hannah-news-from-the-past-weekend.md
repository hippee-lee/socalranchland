Thoughts that need to be written down so I don&#8217;t forget them:

  1. Hannah knows what work is, sort of. This morning she woke up late, 7:30. (Such a great little sleeper) And Her first words to me were &#8220;Mama?&#8221; I am pretty sure she was asking where was Momma. So I said, &#8220;Mama&#8217;s not here kiddo, she is gone already.&#8221; To which she replied, &#8220;work.&#8221; Later she did it again when Julie was on the phone.
  2. Strange Animal signs. When Julie was going through the letter flashcards she did this cute elephant trunk simulation with her arm. I took a video of it but haven&#8217;t processed the raw footage yet. I&#8217;ll try to get it posted before we leave for North Carolina on vacation.
  3. While we were on a date night last night Hannah hung out with Shaye. Apparently they spent a few minutes pointing to each other and saying their names. Hannah points at Shaye and says, &#8220;Saye.&#8221; (I think she is still working on some of her phonetics). Then Shaye points at Hannah and says, &#8220;Hannah&#8221;. Form what I heard this repeated for a while.
  4. Cleaning. Hannah is a little<!--more--> clean freak. She takes her kleenexes and will wipe the counch, the floor, the walls, the dogs, me, the cabinets&#8230; etc if she sees one of cleaning. A very good helper, but she gets a little upset at the broom when it doesn&#8217;t cooperate. After Julie had cleaned the kitchen Hannah took the full sizes broom and was trying to push it around the table. It got caught on a chair (cause its 2x taller then she is) and got mad at it, started yelling about her frusterations.

We also go a bike trailer off Craigslist for her so we will be trying that out soon, hopefully she likes to go for rides &#8230;

The pic is from the previous weekend. Julies cousin was in town and they wanted to hang out on Pearl Street Mall. While they were shopping Hannah played with some rocks.
