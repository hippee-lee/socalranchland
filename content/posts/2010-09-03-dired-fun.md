I finally forced myself to figure out how to use the &#8220;dired-do-query-replace-regexp&#8221; command (Q) with marked files in the dired buffer. Turns out it is pretty simple and very handy for inserting google analytics tracking code into website files all at once.

Last night, after a silly and frustrating week I was so glad to sit outside with my wife and compare war stories.

Today, it&#8217;s my not so new friend emacs that was there to lend a hand. I am very glad this week is almost over.
