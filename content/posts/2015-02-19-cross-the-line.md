Early morning thought for more exploration at some point:

Go right up to the line. Study it, learn about its history and why its where it is at that moment. Then, press your index finger up against it and see how it responds. Is it stretchy and membrane like? is it porous or brittle? Does it deliver an electric shock to your system? You won&#8217;t know if you never try to cross the line.
