This year Hannah had her Holiday concert. She and her class were organized and on tempo with the music. Along with her questions about Santa she is truly beginning to understand the world she moves through. I liked how she fiddled with her antlers, I am sure I ould have done the same if I could have even kept them on my head. 

I think that this next year will provide me with a tripod. Try as ia might and hard as I could the video was jerky and shaky. The stills are better than that and perhaps another way to deal with shaky video is to just extract the sound and take good stills? No, I still want a tripod so I can get decent video when I want to.

Here is the video of Hannahs Holiday Songs in 2011.
