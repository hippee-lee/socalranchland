It was snowing today. Not to much, just a few inches but it was cold outside so I decided to go to the Gym. Getting up at 5:15 is no to hard once your body is moving. After quickly going through my weights routine I headed over to the stationary bike. After last Friday it made me feel nostalgic for Ventura County&#8217;s weather.

On a stationary bike I just set the resistance and started peddling. For variety I will increase the mph&#8217;s every other minute for thirty seconds. so if I am able to easily do 20 mph then i&#8217;ll kick it up to 24 miles per hour for thirty seconds. It does get a bit boring but thats when I engage my imagination. Today I had thoughts of the Guadalesca Trail in Sycamore for a while. Towards the end of my thirty minutes I began thinking about spring coming in Colorado and looking forward to Walker Ranch and Winterpark Riding. WInterpark prolly came up because we are headed up there with some fellow Lilac Circle families for a relaxing weekend of snowboarding.
