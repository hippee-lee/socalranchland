Last night Julie and I decided that your first real word is &#8220;Hi.&#8221; You say hi to everything and its really funny. We were sitting outside on the patio having dinner and you said hi to both Gurgi and Whitney, Bella and a plane flying by in the sky. This morning on the walk to The Heathers, you said hi to the clouds, a few houses, the guy walking his dog, Bella who was following us and Mason and Marie when we got inside the house.Ã‚Â 

I need to remember to bring the video camera to your room when I put you to sleep so I can have it there when you wake up in the morning. Thats when you are most talkative. You are getting better at walking. I haven&#8217;t seen it yet but Marie says you can take 6 steps on your own without any assistance. I betcha that by the time we get to Maui in October you will be mostly walking on your own.Ã‚Â 

Your other recent behavior is to point (and say &#8220;Hi&#8221;). You really like it when I point back at you and touch you ET style. You still like to High-Five but pointing is<!--more--> where its at for now.Ã‚Â 

Summer is almost over and the nights are getting much cooler and shorter as well. Seeing how summer is almost over I need to finish cleaning up the patio and make a real dog run for Gurgi and Whitney in the side yard. The plan is to move all the clay that I removed for the retaining wall over to the east side of the house to fill in the low spots where the backfill has sunk and level it off a little bit. Then I am going to &#8220;t&#8221; off of the existing split rail fence over to the house and make a real gate. The final step will be to lay down some landscapers material and get a few tons of pebble sized rocks so that we can at least walk on it. Oh yes, I also still need to fix the electrical where the backfill sunk and pulled the pipe down. This will make the side yard a little easier to use as a dog run and entry way to the yard. My long term plan for it is to make a path of pavers that leads to the patio.
