Before the storms roll through and they open up the back part of Vasquez Cirque, there is a loop that will provide all the powder and trees that I want. And it is only an hour and a half from my front door. Once you get there you can relax and enjoy the ride, the loop automatically repeats until only the base case is left.

Here is what you need to know:

You should be comfortable on packed or powder. Moguls will be fun for you and you connect more turns than you miss. Trees are good, less people go there and the snow stays soft and the sound is muted. You are comfortable with the Cirque and the high speed (50-60 mph) run out down to the tree line.

Take Pano Express and start down the catwalk. Take your time, everyone is going fast so they can make the traverse. We will not be going that far. Keep your eyes peeled riders left and take the turn off to Bella Fourche.

If you are listening to something good, turn in up and head down the path. After you pass the snow fences, look for your line between the trees. Keep your eyes peeled, there<!--more--> are glades of powder that open up with beautiful turns for your line.

You want to generally turn left as you descend through the trees. If you keep goind south, you will either find a path through big, fun rocks and boulders or, you will dump out on the path that leads to Eagle Wind.

Take Eagle Wind lift and head towards Primrose. Keep you eyes peeled for a small cluster of pine trees and circle back towards them. There is soft snow and a drop off as you head back over to Lupin. Stay near the trees and keep that speed up so you can get a few more turns before the moguls.

Enjoy those trees and head down to Pano Express.

Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Repeat as needed ðŸ™‚<figure id="attachment_1628" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
