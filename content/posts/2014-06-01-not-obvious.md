The answer we seek is not always obvious. As we grow and gain experience we become skilled in sussing out the easy answers. But what about when it&#8217;s hard? When the path is not as well traveled? 

Walk on soldier. Persevere and gain the victors spoils for they are well worth the price you must pay.
