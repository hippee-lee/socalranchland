I bought a pack of gum because it was titled &#8220;Ascent.&#8221; Since its wintertime and Mt. Baldy is collecting snow it made sense to me that that was the right pack of gum for me. They have a marketing gimmick for truth or dare and these two truth questions stood out for me:

> Question:
> 
> Would you rather fly or drive across the country?
> 
> Answer:
> 
> Drive &#8211; its more scenic, less stressful than airports and only has the con of needing to make personal time to do it.
> 
> QuestionÂ 2:
> 
> Would you rather bird-watch or stargaze?
> 
> Answer:
> 
> Stargaze. Space is cool and there may be birds on other planets.
