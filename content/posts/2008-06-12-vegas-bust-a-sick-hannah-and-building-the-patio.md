Busted in Vegas. It seems that people play jack 4 offsuit offline as well as online. Hah. Oh well, I guess that even though he was playing like a maniac, I should have thought a little more before calling his all in with only top pair after the flop. I played good other that that, there was just one other really bad call that I made. Until I lost to MR J4o I was up about $200, the pot with the maniac was the biggest pot I have ever been in before ($475) I am letting people draw too much I think and I could use a healthy dose of aggression to my game. Other times I bet the flop with what I thought was the best hand but didn&#8217;t follow up on the turn and let one person get a straight and another person get to a flush draw. Hmm, need to start being more aggressive post flop when I play strong hands and hit part of the flop. That might give me more information if I bet or reraise when I am in position. Other that those types of hands (and the J4o) I played well from position. Had<!--more--> fun but am still upset at losing all my chips to the dude with J4o. One other thing to note, I saw very effective use (against me and other &#8216;fish&#8217; at the table) of a 2x reraise on the turn and on the river. These bets were usually between 30-75 dollars and made me fold average hands after they checked, I bet and they re-raised. Useful information for the next time I play 1-2NL.

Hannah was sick this week. Running a temp and cranky! I took a sick day yesterday to stay home with her and she would go through a period of being fine and playing and then two minutes later she would just want to be held. Not to many smiles form her though so I hope she gets better soon and we see the return of her sunny personality. She slept ok last night, I brought her to bed around midnight and put her to bed with me. Julie needed a good night sleep so she went to the guest bedroom. Hannah woke up a few times but easily went back to sleep when I cuddled with her.

I hate river rock. Whoever decided to make that a standard part of landscaping should be forced to remove it from my backyard. Whatever happend to xeroscaping with mulch beds and low water use perennials? Right now I am removing the stupid river rock from where the patio will be so I can start to build the retaining wall it will need. The retaining wall will not have to be as tall as I initially thought. Oh, is this going to be a pain in the ass! And after college I though I was done with landscaping forever. Hah!

I need to reinstall the latest wordpress upgrade, I noticed that my√É‚Äö√Ç categories√É‚Äö√Ç are broken üôÅ
