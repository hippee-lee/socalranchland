Hannah told me that she pretends to be a little pink monster. She has added &#8216;Scared of Monsters&#8217; to the bed time stalling routine of read books, drink water, go potty, get Whitney & Gurgi, play songs on the guitar and talking.

Tonight we talked about playing in the pool and she was specific about differntiating girls stuff: bandaids, hello kitty and Mommy&#8217;s activities from &#8216;boy stuff&#8217;.

One of the greatest pleasures of bing a parent is the short time between &#8220;The Day&#8221; and &#8220;Asleep.&#8221; it can also be an exhausting period of frustration (See the you tube video of Samual L Jackson readingÂ <a href="http://youtu.be/E--R1n3O_m4" target="_blank">GTFTS</a>) . It&#8217;s a short period of time when all the conditions are right. Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)" target="_blank">Golden Hour</a> (also known as the magic hour) The conversations we have are priceless and I never know what direction the conversation is going to go.
