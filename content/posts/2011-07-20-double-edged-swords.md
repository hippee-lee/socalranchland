Thats what I tell myself. Everything is a double edged sword. If I can&#8217;t find the good I look for the useful. Thats why I find my self ambivalent to the ie ecosystem. That is where I have been hanging out for a few weeks and I have learned a few things about what I&#8217;m used to and what I prefer. So, while its a crappy platform for the web, it&#8217;s also over five years old. I&#8217;ll bet if I tried to understand five year old firefox bugs it would be equally frustrating. What it comes down to is that Mozilla has done a better job of keeping their users up to date with the latest and greatest and while the web has moved on, ie7 has not.

So, shile running down table-layout: fixed oddness in ie7 I was struck by how much more useable chrome and firebugs tools are. They just feel slow in ie7.

I remember when I first discovered firebug. While really useful when compared to the web developer extension, it was rough around the edges and crashed on me a few times. 

So whats the difference? Why are Chrome and Firebug so much better for me now? The web<!--more--> is always on and operating systems (until today) were shipped on cd&#8217;s and dvd&#8217;s. Also, on you are never all the way right, but if your site is down you are always wrong. So they found find ways to get closer to right. And learned from the mistakes. I don&#8217;t know about the best ways to produce software but I do know when I use software I like.

When it&#8217;s software I don&#8217;t like I can still practice &#8211; patience and repetition. It seems that is what it comes down to for many things. Patience and repetition. Just. Keep Going.
