We felt and saw Hannahs fourth tooth on Sunday. She is getting closer to sitting up and, when sitting up, she is starting to lean forward in order to grab things that she wants. This morning, in bed, it was funny cause she would topple over and immediatly go into roll mode. Thats my girl &#8230; she is already learning the proper way to fall.

Apple gives a one year warranty for most of its products. My phone has been acting up so I took it in for some trouble shooting. They walked you through the usual steps of resetting the network connections and restoring the software but nothing really helped. People who were calling me still kept hearing echos on thier end. When I went back I was pleasantly surprised that the tech at teh Genius Bar just popped out my SIM card and swapped it into a new phone. This time I got the rubber condom for protection, but no belt clip for me.

The Lilac Circle Papas are headed to Vegas thursday night. I want to play tight/aggressive and double up my money. I am taking three buy ins for the 1/2 NL game and expect that good things will<!--more--> happen. I also want to try and see one of the WSOP events that are going one. I think there might even be one or two 10k buy-in events going one. Other than that maybe some sun by the pool and I&#8217;ll be cool.
