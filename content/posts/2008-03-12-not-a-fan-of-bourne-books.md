I am trying to read the three Bourne books by Robert Ludlum. I just can&#8217;t seem to get into them. I thought the first book was kinda slow or dull or both. I am about halfway through the second one and it is just dragging on and on while I don&#8217;t really care about any of the characters. I haven&#8217;t ever read anything by Ludlum before but for all the books he sold I expected a better story that this. Perhaps I am influenced by the movies, which I liked. Usually though, I like the books much better thatn the movies, even when the movies are good.

I might have to put them on a shelf and come back to them later, if there is time as I recieved five or six books for christmas and haven&#8217;t read any except for the Bourne series.
