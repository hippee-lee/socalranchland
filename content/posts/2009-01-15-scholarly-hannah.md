Hannah has been on a crazy book kick lately. In the morning she brings me four or five books to read and point out things she knows. Mainly she knows the animals. In the evening, she will do the same. Once, when I was helping Julie get dinner ready she kept bringing the Encyclopedia book to both of us and got pissed when we told her she had to wait a few minutes. It was so traumatic that she started banging her head on the floor! 

A list of words and signs that Hannah knows:
  
Word->Hannahs version
  
Dog -> dada
  
Kitty -> Bella
  
Horse -> BoBo
  
Papa -> me
  
Mama -> Julie
  
Fish -> fshhh (no sign)
  
Up -> up
  
Hat -> attsch
  
Hello -> lolo (when she uses this one she puts a phone up to her head and says it)
  
Cow -> dow
  
Moon -> oon
