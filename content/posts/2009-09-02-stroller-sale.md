Hannah is helping me to sell the double stroller we got for when she and Mason were hanging out during the week days &#8230;

Oh, things she has been up to:

  1. singing an almost complete version of the abc&#8217;s
  2. putting shoes on
  3. missing her mama in the morning
  4. completing full sentences that convey her understanding of more abstract concepts: Papa is Matthew, Mama is work.
  5. chasing Whitney around. (she seems fascinated with their short stubby boxer Tails lately)
  6. Eating flank steak &#8211; dad grilled some and Hannah wouldn&#8217;t stop eating it. She had a super full mouth because it was tough to chew.
