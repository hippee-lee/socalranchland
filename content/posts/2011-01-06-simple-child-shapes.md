Here is my vision for the css3zen design. The theme is simple child shapes, blocks, circles, triangles and rectangles &#8211; The first shapes that Hannah recognized. Since there is a child element we will keep the colors to primary (but you can use transparency if needed).

The layout will be simple, blocky and make use of whitespace. The imagry will incorporate the shapes theme and I&#8217;ll use gimp to create them.

The css will be written with compass and I want to use as much css3 as I can. Since my goal is not to submit the design to the contest, I think it is too late for that, I will focus on the current trends in webpage design that I like:

Headers and footers that expand to the whole width of the browser window and centered content.

Here is the repository: <https://bitbucket.org/hippeelee/css3zen>

A reference to the pages structure:
