  1. Grow Into Brilliance &#8211; Learn to be brilliant by diving deep into your area of expertise. Continue learning and stay up to date after you leave your schooling behind.
  2. Demonstrate Determination &#8211; Sticking with it longer than others will take you far. Having grit to push through (tough problems, frustrations, feedback and critics) will open up a variety of paths to choose from and set you apart.
  3. Cultivate Curiosity &#8211; Be curious and it will guide you when you don&#8217;t know what to do or where to start. Cultivate the ability to **start** by changing one thing no matter how small or large. Change things and ask how and what questions to see where they take you.
  4. Be A Teammate &#8211; be collaborative and seek out the same in others. No one can do great things alone.
  5. Realistic Idealism &#8211; Learn to balance the practicality of **what must be done/shipped **with a willingness to challenge the way things are in order to find a better way while still producing **something** that the real world can give you feedback on.
