Hannah is rapidly developin her language skills. if you can say it she will repeat it. she really likes sining her songs and demands that we listen to Hannah&#8217;s music when driving in the car.

she sometimes recognizes letter a or b but its still hit or miss. fine motor skills are in evidence as she deftly deconstructs her PB&J sandwiches. she is a dare devil. my mom would prolly say i was ecactly like her but worse. she shows very little fear at the physical unknown. this means she will jump off most things, try to climb everything and is getting faster when she runs away from me giggling. 

she does show fear; when i scare her i think she likes it but when &#8216;bad&#8217; things happen in a cartoon she gets visably worried and asks questions about what going to happen.
