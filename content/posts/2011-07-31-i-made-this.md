I built this. It is a split level addition to the deck. Complete with rose garden and paved path next to the house that leads to a sitting area (or golfers private driving range?) where you can watch your garden grow as golfers play through just like on tv.

After I got done yesterday (The hottest day of the year) I sat, watched and I enjoyed a cool, refreshing beverage.

Yesterday, after I finished the heavy manual parts, we took Hannah to see a U2 cover band headline one of the Erie Concerts in the park series. I really enjoy them and like it better in the new park. Hannah was fascinated with the band, Once the Chik Fil A cow got out of the way she got her rock and roll dance on. It was fun &#8211; I swung her around, showed her the hop and she carried the Irish flag around for a while. Although I think they do stuff with flag like shapes outside at school and her and Shaye seemed to want to shake the flag more than carry it.

Did I mention that this was the hottest day of the year? The car registered 101 when we got the<!--more--> park at 5:30pm.
