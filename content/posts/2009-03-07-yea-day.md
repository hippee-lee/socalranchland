Busy morning. Got tons of stuff done ðŸ™‚

Changed the oil in the Murano. I&#8217;ll drop off the used stuff on our way to the butterfly zoo later today but I still need to find a place for used oil filters.

Waxed poetic on my snowboard so I am ready for some speed runs down the cirque. I hope that the cornice drop is still at the top of the run I was riding a few weeks ago. It was a nice 5-6 footer.

Took the dogs for a walk this morning to get coffee from the new 7-11 that opened up by highway 7. Yum!

Looked into using an absolutely positioned, hidden div with a little canvas overlay animation instead a separate page for the about statement. Should not take to long to implement. Ha! With stuff to do, my little kiddo it should have it done within six months or so.

Now we are getting ready to take Hannah to the butterfly zoo in Broomfiled. And, later tonight I&#8217;ll be winning some shoe money at the poker games.
