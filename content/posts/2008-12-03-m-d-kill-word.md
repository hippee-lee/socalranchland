I accidentally stumbled accress this yesterday and started using it in my editing today. Meta-d (M-d) will delete the entire string inside quotes. It also deleted tabs and spaces from the beginning of the line up to and including the first word it came to. Little things are fun and now I will happily spend the rest of today killing words. ðŸ™‚
