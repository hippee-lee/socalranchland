I finished up the whole house humidifier wednesday and it is working normally. Julie notices a difference, and i can too. I think it is more noticeable in the morning. Since the humidifier is only on when the fan or heater is on I am running the fan to circulate air in the evenings.

I still need to upload my pictures and put them into a howto post.
