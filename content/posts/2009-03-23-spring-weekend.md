Well Spring arrived in a big way this weekend with clear blue skys and temps in the mid 70&#8217;s. Yesterday, e got the lawn ready by power raking it and top seeding. Hannah helped us by bonking her head three times and falling off the patio once, right on her face.

What else did we do, On Saturday we went to the REI grand opening at the Orchard Town Center Mall but did not stand in line for the free gift cards. We got water bottles though. They should come in handy since Julie got rid of all the &#8216;bad&#8217; water bottles we had which contained BPA&#8217;s. We also go out to BoBo who was looking pretty good with his newly trimmed hooves.

Saturday night I went with Cory to the Wildgrass Poker tournament and finally placed (7th). It was fun, those guys run a really laid back tournament and I like the atmoshphere.

These pictures of of the Pear Tree in our yard which is starting to bloom. I&#8217;ll try to take some more pictures of the flowers as they develop. Hopefully they will not be killed with the cold weather that moved in to the region this week.
