They say that its the little things that kill. The straw that breaks the camels back.

Conversely it is the little things the make large efforts worthwhile. A hand on your shoulder and a word of encouragement; a well timed challenge to make it keep going, The power we have in our every day lives to influence begins and depends on the little things we do. I see this as a father. It can be an exercise in humility (Of course I am always wrong and the sky is not blue) and a marathon of patience (It is time to get dressed, we need to leave for school; it is time to get dressed, we need to leave for school; it is time to get dressed, we need to leave for school &#8230; and on and on every day ðŸ™‚ )

So when I uncover something like the scan below I hold it close and enjoy the moments we have to talk about it and smile. I remind myself that just because I am the teacher I still have much to learn and re-learn and that I have a choice every day to help break someones back or find an opportunity to place a hand on someones shoulder and lift them up. It is the little things that help that are worth so much.
