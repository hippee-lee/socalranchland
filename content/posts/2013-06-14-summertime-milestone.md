I can&#8217;t believe she is moving on from kindergarten. It seems like the long days of home work and coordinating drop offs, pickups and school events coalesce into a brief moment that passes by while I was blinking. 

Now she can read, to me. Now she can do math, well adding and subtracting. Now she has bff&#8217;s &#8211; although they are quite dynamic. Now she can dress herself for uniform days or free dress days and she knows better than info what the rules are. Now she can use a computer but she is better with the iPad &#8211; even though she got a G on her report card. 

Now she is a first grader. In other, unrelated events, input the dev version of iOS 7 on my dev device so I could finish my game by the end of this year. While the work focus switches back to web and Angular in particular, I don&#8217;t want to fall behind where Xcode is going so this motivates me to set up all the new goodies at home.
