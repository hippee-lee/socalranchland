No traveling, nothing urgent to do this past weekend and good time spent with Hannah made the weekend alot of fun. It started on Friday night when we got all the children together for some dinner. They were very cute playing together. Then we had some Wii time, Smash Bros & Martio Kart. A couple of beers and then off to bed.Ã‚Â 

We got up pretty early and were ready to go hiking on Saturday morning. Just around Betasso Preserve loop ~3.2 miles. Hannah did good on her second training hike, She fell asleep towards the end. On our way back home we stopped for an early lunch at the farmers market. Then it was off to home for a mid day nap. It was a very good nap. Woke up around 3:00 or so and played with Hannah some more while Julie went out to see Mr Bo. We had dinner and put Hannah to bed at her usual time and then watched a movie, Juno. It was pretty good. It gave me an idea for how to manage my Netflix queue. Instead of waiting for them to recommend a move for me, I just look at what is currently<!--more--> playing at the theater that I want to see and request it. It seems like all of the current titles are already in there and you can just get on the waiting list. I don&#8217;t like the wayÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â recommendationÃ‚Â engine works and it seems harder to find all of the current releases that are playing in theaters now.Ã‚Â 

Sunday I slept in until around 8:30 or so and got ready for a productive day. We tried to take the Volvo in for tire rotation but itÃ‚Â doesn&#8217;tÃ‚Â need it for 3K more miles. We ran some more errands and then I came home and changed the oil in the Murano while Julie potted a couple of flowers for the front porch. Hannah supervised while in her bouncy walker & Gurgi & Whitney were on guard. We tried to get Hannah to take a nap in the afternoon, she was giving all the tired signs but fighting it, but she wouldn&#8217;t go down for a nap so Julie took her over to play with her friend Shaye. I went for a short bike ride and started getting ready for the Silverton 50 in Leadville later this summer. I rode form our house to Anthem and then circled back to Highway 7 on Sheridan Pkwy. Then I went east on 7 to County Rd 7 and north to County Rd 6. I circled back towards Vista Ridge on County Rd 5 and them meandered through Vista Ridge back to the house. Total distance was about 17 miles. If I do that twice it should be a decent training ride for the S-50. THen we fed Miss Hannah dinner and put her down a little early on account of her not sleeping all day. She slept ok, woke up a few times but put herself back under. I think Julie got up withÃ‚Â herÃ‚Â at 1:30.
