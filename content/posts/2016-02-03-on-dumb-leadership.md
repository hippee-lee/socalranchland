Anyone can be a leader and everyone should lead something. We are all professionals and experts at the things we do most.

From what I see, the best leaders are always learning. They ask questions, teach them selves new things and effectively identify those in the next generation with the most fearless voices. The ones who are optimistic that anything can happen. Anything at all.&nbsp;

As a parent I struggle to ride the line between efficiency and wading through all of the noise that my next generation emits and letting her explore and broadcast her way to where I need her to be. She does have a lot of noise but as she grows I see and hear novel ideas that I didn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t have. There is clarity in her purpose to see and know EVERYTHING.&nbsp;

The leaders who know that they are dumb in the grand scheme of things, the ones who know they have tons of room to learn, those are the ones who will cultivate and grow the best ideas for the next generation.
