We didn&#8217;t go up to Winterpark this weekend. I tried to make it up to eldora but that didn&#8217;t happen either. We did take Hannah to the zoo. I got the whole house humidifier installed and played some wii after Hannah went to sleep.

We also got a kid carrier for Hannah, a sherpani I think. Hiking this spring should be fun. One way to make sure it happens enough is to put it on my google calander and then send invatations/reminders to other interested parties.

Hannah is what I would call a droolyface fussyhead right now so I think I am done.
