    Good weekend, great weather. We went for two &#8216;hikes&#8217; this weekend with Hannah. Last Saturday Julie and I got up early, went to breakfast at the farmers market on 11th St. Later we went up to the Bebaso trail/loop west of Boulder. Hannah first hike was fun. SHe fell asleep for the first half but was awake for the last mile or so.Ã‚Â On Sunday we went with Cory, Jen and Mason and walked around on the Boulder Creek Path. Both hikes were great little warmups and I look forward to so good backpacking with her.Ã‚Â On Friday, when I fed Hannah dinner, she started a new behavior. When I gave her the sign for &#8216;eat&#8217; and showed her the spoonful of baby food she opened her mouth like a little birdie. It was very cute. She did it until she got full or tired of the repetition. Watching her this past weekend I saw that she is starting to give signs of wanting but I don&#8217;t think she knows she is doing it yet. Besides opening her mouth like a little bird, sheÃ‚Â definitelyÃ‚Â has moments when she only wants Momma :)Ã‚Â Also, little miss I hate<!--more--> tummy time is starting to go from her back to her front when she sees something interesting that she wants. If you put her down on her stomach, sheÃ‚Â immediatelyÃ‚Â flips over 180 degrees to her back. but if something catches her eye she will reach and twist most of her body over to tummy side to get what she wants.Ã‚Â </div>
