Yesterday Marie reported that Hannah popped her first tooth. That explains why she was so cranky Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in San Francisco. Yeah, she only has [19 more](http://www.bjc.org/bjc_about_content.aspx?id=2038) to go ðŸ˜‰

On tap for tonight, after Julie gets home from picking up the Volvo is Wii at the Heathers, I think Cory got the Super Mario Carts game and I just got the Super Smash brothers game so it should be fun.

The weather is not supposed to be all that great but we are still going to try to go for a hike on Saturday morning.
