I could use some of this flavor of comedy after hearing about all of the fake news this week. The rules have changes for sure.&nbsp;

It seems like they are the same as last time around. Same as they always are.&nbsp;

> It starts with me and I don&#8217;t take critique well. I struggle with shutting my mouth long enough for the rational part of my brain to separate the intel I have been given from the emotional response that desperately wants to leap from my mouth.&nbsp;

I&#8217;ve gotten better at knee jerk reactions. I try to have empathy first when interacting in life. That helps but its a constant practice just to make progress.&nbsp;

The thing about constant practice is that it&#8217;s humbling to go back to the basics and force yourself to &#8216;brush up&#8217; on something you take for granted.&nbsp;

That&#8217;s the biggest challenge for the American voter. Learning to learn with empathy. We think they know our government. We don&#8217;t. We think we know politics. We don&#8217;t. We think we know our fellow americons. We don&#8217;t. We make the same mistake I&#8217;ve seen many a start-up &#8216;founder&#8217; make. They know the product and if it gets built the users will come. But come hell or high water they don&#8217;t need to talk to people to understand _what_&nbsp;to build. They already know what to build. And build they do. Right up until they have wasted all the money, without ever having engaged in conversation with their customers.&nbsp;

Talk to the people, that is the key. It takes empathy and adaptability but it will unlock the imagination of ourselves and the new American Dream.&nbsp;
