I believe that we all have ideas. Some good, some different and some that are meh. Together we can assemble ideas that can solve the biggest of problems. These pieces of the puzzle are more difficult to mine than diamonds and gold but are infinitely more valuable when we put them together in a variety of ways with other ideas from like minded folks.&nbsp;
