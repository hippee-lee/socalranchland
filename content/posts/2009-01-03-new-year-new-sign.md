Hannah signed &#8216;horse&#8217; for me the other day. The only thing is she thinks all harses are called &#8216;BoBo&#8217;. 

Other stuff: got the lights taken down and the truck running today. It&#8217;s prolly not the fuel pump. Maybe the cold start sensor? I&#8217;ll need to do some more googling to see what the internets say. 

Other things to do: finish the script to grep out five images from the blog images. Then I can see if I can use the plugin to load ten into a javascript array on the main page load. 

Still need to check the outlet on the front porch. Hopefully just a loose connection or a bad plug. 

If I could change anything about our house it would have more windows in the south and west.
