When I was a child my mother and grandmother made something called pizza frit. It was really simple but really good. Fried dough rolled in sugar. 

When I was in high school I would camp out in the back woods on my parents property and mom would bring us a huge bowl of pizza frit. 

I recall this because Julie took me out to Lucile&#8217;s for breakfast and they had pizza frit (they used a different name and powdered sugar instead of granulated but it was the same). 

Yummy goodness, even if the roads are closed and I have to wait until tommorrow to ride Winterparks three feet of spring powder.
