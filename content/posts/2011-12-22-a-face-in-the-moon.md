I&#8217;m impressed, iPhoto&#8217;s facial recognition software can also id the moon. I mean, I have always known that there was a man on the moon and that when it was full there was an eye and nose that are clearly visible so I guess it would be a good training object.<figure id="attachment_2955" style="width: 313px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
