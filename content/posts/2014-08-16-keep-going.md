Steve Jobs on problem solving:

> When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don’t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it’s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s sort of the middle, and that’s where most people stop… But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem — and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works.

So it would seem that I&#8217;m in the middle of faceted search. It just has so many facets to making an initiative flow to narrow in on a customers desire. Pardon the facet pun. Here are a few:

  1. Loosely defined association between the products queried for and the facets returned
  2. The relationship between the URL and the user selections as they narrow the result set
  3. The programatic and business case for building it in such a way that it can be used and reused in the same theme or a different theme with only style or view changes to the directive
  4. The prototypal nature of the toolbox&#8217;s origins
  5. The desire to document toolboxes design, dependencies and pathways so it is clearly understood and simple to use
