The web is an infinite canvas. Anyone can create a page with a bit of html and even make it look nice with some css. Word processors are infinite canvases &#8211; just open up a new page and you can write whatever you want to.<!--more-->

### The Mind Is An Infinite Canvas

We start this young. Every child has been told that they can do and be anything they want. And they can. The human mind is an amazing organ capable of adapting and re-shaping itself time and time again. True, it takes more effort as it ages.

So what stops us from creating a compelling web page or writing that awe inspiring book? What keeps up from re-inventing ourselves at the intersections of the many stages we live through? I believe one of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of ability to identify and set constraints. For ourselves individually, for the projects and groups we work with. For the companies we want to build.

### Constraints Spur Creativity

Arbitrarily putting yourself in a box makes that infinite white canvas a little less daunting. And when it boxes you in it forces you to find a way around it when those certain situations call for it.
