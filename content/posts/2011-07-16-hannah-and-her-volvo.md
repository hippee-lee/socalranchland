This morning while I was doing yard work Hannah did some work of her own. She went to the store (for real this time) and packed for camping. Now we are off to the store for some more sprinkler system parts and wood for the garden boxes.



Watching her at play is educational for me. I think my challenge as a parent is to disguise my advice (tips, tricks and my accumulated knowledge) in a way that she will accept it as her own idea. Just outright telling her how she should do something does not seem to be a good way to guide her. More on this topic later.
