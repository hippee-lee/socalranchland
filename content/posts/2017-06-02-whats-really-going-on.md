    <span data-offset-key="8kj9l-0-0">I don&#8217;t usually post political things on Facebook because I read so many comments from strangers in my country that are so, so, whats the word &#8230;. Luddite comes close but its not quite right. I hate that. I hate that some of those comments are from friends and family who are good people and when I engage with them its an unproductive conversation about apples and oranges. But, I hate what the whiney and grumpy old man in the white house did yesterday on many, many levels so I&#8217;m going to make some observations hereFirst about. I hope at the very least you can *try* to understand where I am coming from. </span>

### <!--more-->

#### First, a bit more about discussion on Facebook:

<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="at2b3" data-offset-key="8kbn6-0-0">
  <div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="8kbn6-0-0">
    <span data-offset-key="8kbn6-0-0">I read comments that demonstrate a complete incapacity of empathizing with the other viewpoint for the sake of discussion and I don&#8217;t understand why. In some ways its sad because I want to participate in the conversation but can&#8217;t get over the feeling that it&#8217;s pointless when the folks who are online can&#8217;t differentiate between empathy (for the sake of understanding and persuasion) and sympathy (feeling sorry for someone&#8217;s different state of mind and belief system). If you can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) put yourself in someone else&#8217;s shoes you will never understand them. And as Carmine Falcone said, &#8220;And you always fear what you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</span>

    Moving on to science:

  <div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="296au-0-0">
    <span data-offset-key="296au-0-0">The point to the intro above is to highlight how difficult it is to have a real, meaningful and production conversation online when politics and science are involved. Many folks never actually seek out the research or data so they can come to their own conclusions. It&#8217;s kind of like buying the first thing in an Amazon product search without reading the description (research) or product reviews (peer review). Only shitty consumers would do that, right? Same thing when you consume scientific research, if you outsource it by letting any news organization summarize it for you then you are missing out on the experience of doing your own shopping. You are stuck with their biases and mistakes.</span>

    <span data-offset-key="bgkhh-0-0">So, I require that anyone wishing to comment on this post read the linked research. You can do it. Its long but will help the conversation if we all have a common baseline to start our arguments with. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you draw different conclusions from mine. We can&#8217;t have a good conversation about it if we are not referencing the same data. Again, its long but you can do it. Take it one section at a time and digest it like a good meal. You will naturally come to your own feel for the conclusions as well as the data they are based on.</span>

    <span data-offset-key="5n340-0-0">Climate change is real and people all over the world are contributing and causing changes faster than would naturally occur. This is neither good or bad, it is where we are today. At least, thats what I conclude after reading the linked paper below. My first (educational) love in life was biology &#8211; I was and still am fasciated by the almost magical way that life evolves and survives on our planet. One of the things I took away from my hybrid education in the real world and college is that, collectively, we are responsible for what happens to life on this planet. If we something wrong and there is something we can do to help we have a moral and ethical responsibility to address it. Pretending something isn&#8217;t a problem or that its not &#8220;my&#8221; problem is unscrupulus and un-ethical. And, me or my child&#8217;s grand-children&#8217;s children will have to clean it up. If they survive.</span>
