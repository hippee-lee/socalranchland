I&#8217;m running out of things to distract Hannah with. She seems to be feeling better but it&#8217;s only been 3.5 hours since she last spiked a temp of ~103. In an effort to create something for her to do and give myself some more time to play with css for today I resorted to the computer. I have heard enought dora and diego the past three days so I need to be creative in how I present things to her.

## So far today &#8230;

She watched the entire pbs kids am lineup, did playdoh and stamps coloring by herself. She got all the basket toys out and got into an argument with Kee the cat.

In an effort to get a few more minutes and avoid anything Dora or Diego, I showed her how to use the track pad and made her click through all my links. More css rules are needed. I also want to take some more of the rules out of JavaScript and put it into the stylesheet.

When that failed to keep her interested (&#8220;Papa I want to play games on your computer,&#8221; she says to me ðŸ™‚ )Enter the old office computer and photoshop. Hannah can use the &#8216;computer pen&#8217;<!--more--> to draw on and showed her how to paint and erase with colors. She asked where all the colors come from and I told her it&#8217;s like the new eco-paints with out the paper and water and the computer makes its own colors.

This three week virus really needs to go though.
