Hanna woke up earlier than usual last night, around 10:30. Julie was aleady asleep so I went to go comfort her. I think she had a scary dream and woke up all alone. She does not like to be alone right now because she calmed down when I changed her diaper and lulled her back to sleep on my shoulder while rocking gently in the corner of her room. I can only try to describe how pleasant I&#8217;d felt to have her nuzle her face into the crook of my shoulder and her left arm around my neck. She was warm, content and I think she just wanted someone there while she fell back to sleep. I hope she had better dreams the second time around. Maybe she saw Clyde.

Last weekend was a good one. One that, upon reflection, I can look back on and say that life is really good. Saturday we got a few things around the house done and I went out to Bo while Julie spent quality time with Hannah and took Whitney to the Vet &#8211; she has an ear infection. In the afternoon, I got a workout in at the gym. I rode for 30<!--more--> minutes but could not stand the stationary bike any more than that. It was too windy to ride outside in the afternoon so that will have to do. Then we went over to the Manes&#8217; house and Hannah and I played wii while the girls had a night out. Hannah didn&#8217;t want to sleep and was alittle bit grumpy &#8230; I think she is getting a second tooth in.

I want to start on the sg::malu story soon. The first part is still a little fuzzy but the second part has gotten pretty clear in the last few months. My goal for the end of this summer is to transcribe my notes into the wp installation at the site.
