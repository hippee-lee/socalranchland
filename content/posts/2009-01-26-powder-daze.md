By Sunday morning, WInterpark had over two feet of fresh powder. I spent the morning riding Parsens bowl until that got really tracked up and the lift line got long. Then I made my way down the catwalk to Eagle Wind and rode in the trees till it closed. I found some thigh high stashes but most of it was mid calf or knee high.
