Today, I gave up on using chrome for google apps. Ever since they opened up google+ for public use they changed something about the authentication system and my computer running chrome really does not like it. It makes me log in to each app multiple times per day. Intermittently I would get the you must enable javascript or clearn you cache and cookies blah blah blah. Well its been several months and JavaScript has always been enabled. I think my cache and cookies are clear enough to fry an egg on. 

I have even tried to uninstall and re-install but not that the time spent trying to figure out why wants me to log in for each app, multiple time a day it is time to use tool that don&#8217;t get in the way of what I need or want to do and re-logging into a web service multiple times a day is not what I want to do.

So I went back to firefox for google plus and the document s. I am going to use apples mail and cal apps for those accounts. I guess the plus side is that I don&#8217;t need to see any of the adds &#8211;<!--more--> not that they really bother me that much. It&#8217;s been a while since I used them so we will see if I like the changes to the native apps.

For web development Chrome is the best browser right now, ironically for me, whatever changes they have been making to it have rendered it completely unusable to me for their web apple (mail.cal/documents etc) in Chrome because of this weird log in issue for their web apps.

Odd is on his lane tonight. Must bee the moon or electromagnetic interference that is causing this oddness. It must be.
