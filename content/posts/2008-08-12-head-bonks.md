Hannah, you crack me up. There are little bruises that ate migrating around your forehead. I can see how it hurts you when you Bonk your heavy little head. But sometimes, sometimes it&#8217;s really funny and your momma and I can&#8217;t help buy laugh.

Like tonight when we were lying on the floor playing, crawling and reading books and you were so happy. You werr just sitting there babbling and jumping on us and then I gave you the moracca. You excitedly took it from me and promptly bonked your self in the head with it. I think the worldnended for you and for the next few minutes, while we tried not to laugh to much, you were completely inconsolable. Then after you prostrated yourself in childs pose a few times and threw yourself onto momma a couple times you gotn better and went on reading a book.
