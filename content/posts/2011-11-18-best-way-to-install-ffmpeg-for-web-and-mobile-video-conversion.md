I have been struggling with the default install of ffmpeg on centOS5 and went to HandbrakeCLI for easy conversion. However, we need a tool that will convert videos for web (this means x264 and other formats for chrome) and iOS devices. 

The stock yum install of ffmpeg on centos (i386) is at 0.6ish. I think its time to upgrade our servers because trying to create webm video is just not working. I have tried a few other google results but this one seems to be the best for a modern ffmpeg on CentOS5.

It is almost Thanksgiving and I am grateful there are computer folks out there who are much, much smarter than me when it comes to this kind of thing.
