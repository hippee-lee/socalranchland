One of my new Xmas toys was a stylus that has pressure sensitivity and other things available if the app developer implements it. It talks Bluetooth and unfortunately wacom decided to use aaaa batteries to power it. No store in the area carry them and all the shady sellers on amazon ( shady because they send them without being in original packaging even though they picture them as such. About half of the reviewers received dead or expired batteries ).<!--more-->

What&#8217;s a curious mind to do? With the help of my little assistant and a quick internet search, aaaa batteries can be found in your friendly Duracell nine cold battery. There are six 1.5v aaaa batteries inside and with a little bit of connection management they work just fine. Take a look:

Note, not all 9v batteries use the cylinder aaaa format. Some use flat cells stacked vertically on top of each other.
