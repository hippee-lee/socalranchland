Restart after installing pocket mac for julie&#8217;s new bb curve? Restart after resettting my sync data? iChat AV doesn&#8217;t work with Robs mac but it works with Dads? Screen sharing via iChat doesn&#8217;t work with Dads computer?

Update: mobile me syncing of dashboard widgets, dock items, keychains, notes and preferences seems to cause BIG problems. Why the $@@$ are they there then? WTF apple, I am really pissed at you today or screwing up my Sunday afternoon. And now I can&#8217;t see iPhoto, Safari or Firefox on my laptop. Please don&#8217;t release anyrhing new until the shit you have &#8216;just works.&#8217; Your shit did not &#8216;just work&#8217; today. 

Dear Santa, please help apple get thief stuff fixed.
