After I upgraded php and wordpress to 2.7 I started getting out of dynamic memory errors. Here is what I am seeing:

> Fatal error: out of dynamic memory in yy\_create\_buffer() in /path/to/my-blog/wp/wp-admin/post.php on line 12

I upped my memory_limit to 256 to give it more to work with but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be enough. I&#8217;ll have to dig around in php.ini and on [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org) to see if anyone else has run across this.

Other php stuff &#8211; I am getting closer to finishing the dashboard page for the site. Yay.
