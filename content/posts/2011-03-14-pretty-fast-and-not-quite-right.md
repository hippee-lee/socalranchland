I count seconds with the unofficial &#8216;one thousand&#8217; standard for timing things. When I say one thousand for a single digit number its roughly equal to a second. I say one thousand a bit faster for anything higher than ten because there are more syllables. The term roughly accurate comes to mind but isn&#8217;t quite right.

Either way the fact that I only counted to fifteen and my new mbp went from off to login screen means that it starts up pretty fast. I think i like these larger solid state drives.
