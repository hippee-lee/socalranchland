Last night was Halloween. Hannah was a Ladybug, and a very cute one at that.

She was a little funny at the Halloween party. I am not sure if it is because she fell off Bobo (Totally her parental units fault), the lack of a nap or something else. At one point, after she got bonked by the swing, she only wanted to play with the toys, she didn&#8217;t want me to talk but she wanted me to stay with her. So, we did the alphabet puzzle. I told her about objects for the letters. So she was able to figure out that the moon associated with &#8216;M&#8217; and so on. Using that, she got all of the letters/puzzle pieces in the correct place.

This morning was back to normal, she helped me get dressed, played with Kee the kitty and had a piece of candy after breakfast.
