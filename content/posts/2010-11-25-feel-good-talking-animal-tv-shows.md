I was looking for something to watch on netflix tonight and came accross the following category:

Up until now I have been unaware of the &#8220;Feel Good Good Talking Animal TV Shows&#8221; Genre. Finding it made me smile.

I really like the Pingu animations. I like to watch them with Hannah because she really gets why it&#8217;s funny. I have never seen someone focus so intently as she does.
