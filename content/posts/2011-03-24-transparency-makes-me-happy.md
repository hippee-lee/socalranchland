Netflix is great. I want them to handle all my media needs.

I tried to watch an episode of Merlin the other day and it didn&#8217;t work. The internets said that Netflix was having issues. Then, a few days later they contact me, acknowledge the issues with an apology and try to make it right.

That transparency makes me happy.
