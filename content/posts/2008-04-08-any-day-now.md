Any day now we expect Hannah to pop her first tooth. She is gumming anythign she can get into her mouth like crazy. Her fist, frozen rubber things with bumps on it, even my fingers. She is starting to like the solid food thing; at least from the output perspective that I have. We have had her on rive and whole grain cereal for about two weeks now and Julie just introduced some fruit this past weekend. Hannah seemed interested in the applesauce. Marie, Masons grandma, who takes care of them during the day told me that Hannah starts making funny faces after she gets full. She might not be a huge fan of the vegetables yet. Maybe she will like the fruit better.

For the record, I have cheated a few times and given her sugar just to see the look on her face. I think she liked it!

I still need to seal the mudjacking cracks in the garage, take off the carrier from the Murano, and clean out the garage with a high pressured sprayer. Prolly not in that order though.
