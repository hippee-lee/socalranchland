I will learn to
  
Hear and understand
  
That ever thing and
  
Everything will pass
  
Into time, it is all
  
Just in my mind

<!--more-->

This line is mine
  
Coming close
  
Together intertwined
  
We will cross. And we will run

Down the slippery slope
  
Valley deep and full
  
Running wet with dream
  
And life finding way

This line in our time
  
Everything goes on by

To give away, I choose
  
To learn and hear and understand
  
All things will pass and
  
I will learn the quiet
  
Moments deep through time
  
Running wet with dreams
  
And hopes and everything
