If I tell someone that I will call them next week, I should call them. If I don&#8217;t, all I will be is the guy who can&#8217;t keep his word.

Maybe that matters and maybe it doesn&#8217;t. If you run in to me down the road before you remember anything else about me, i&#8217;ll bet you remember me as the guy who didn&#8217;t call you back when I said I would.

It&#8217;s not just calling someone back, if I promise to do something and don&#8217;t deliver then everything I say after that is suspect until I find a way to rebuild trust.
