Hannah has been running a fever all day. üôÅ

It started last night and has come and gone in waves all day. To try and make you comfortable we are alternating Tylenol and Motron on a regular interval. It&#8217;s hard when your kiddo is sicko. 

\*update\* Hannah is still got a fever; it&#8217;s now going on three days. It fluctuates between 101 and 104. I am still giving her the Motrin/Tylenol treatments. Since Julie has to work today I am going to take her to the MD and then stay home with her.

\*Update 2\* She was still running a fever this morning so I stayed home with her again. She slept from when Momma left, around 7:30 to 10:30. Hopefully she is just tired for the body battle against the virus and naps like this will replenish her batteries.

Post nap she had a bunch of grapes, some cheerios and JELLO. She learned to slurp the jello off the spoon and thought that was fun.
