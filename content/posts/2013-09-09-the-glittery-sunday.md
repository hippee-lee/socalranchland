This morning Hannah and I did some glitter art. It was inspired by her &#8216;discovery&#8217; of some packets of glitter I found while cleaning the garage last weekend. She &#8216;found&#8217; them on my workbench in the garage. 

We each took charge of one paper but helped each other decorate and gave advice on the art direction for the others project. I&#8217;ll leave it up to you to guess who&#8217;s is who&#8217;s. <!--more-->
