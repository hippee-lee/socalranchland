How can I create an interface if everyone is different &#8211; does things in different ways, prefers their favorite flavors which are different from mine &#8230; has a different emotional reaction than I do?

Previously this seems to have been handled with convention and the law of mass average, The law of mass average is my understanding that if you put a jar full of jellybeans out and ask people to guess the number almost everyone will be wrong. If you average the guesses from everyone you will be very close to the correct answer. This is what convention is. Everyone gets together when they use the same service and interacts with it differently. They buy the same product and react to it on different levels and then give feedback to the provider. It&#8217;s minimal, but even no feedback is feedback for the provider.

I&#8217;m starting The Dark Tower again. I&#8217;m not sure how many times, but I&#8217;ve read the first four books more then ten times now, a bit less for the last three though. I first line is epic in scale: (&#8220;The man in black fled west and the gunslinger followed&#8221;). -Note I need to verify the accuracy of my memory.

I<!--more--> picked up a copy about the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers &#8211; Wow! This is a crazy crazy world. Why is there a link between profoundly creative people and the self destructive patterns many of the most influential artists exhibit? Is the balance between creativity and the behaviors that drive it like a wave that you ride, balancing on top until it crests out &#8211; if your still going when the water recedes you swim back out and try again? Is just showing up enough, or, do you have to kill it every time?

I think this little guy has some questions for us. He kind of looks like a little Ewok hanging from a tree.<figure id="attachment_2310" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
