It hot here for the 29th day in a row so I thought I would give the pups a break from the hundred degree days we have been getting in Erie. I brought them into the office and took this picture on one of their breaks outside. It&#8217;s really cool that I can bring them to work with me. I doubt that I could ever do that at companies like Amgen.
  
I&#8217;ll take them for a short ride tonight after it cools off.
